The Association for Learning Technology has published a [detailed and highly practical guide](http://repository.alt.ac.uk/887/), based on its own experience, for journals moving toward an Open Access model.  Indeed, the guide is of even broader utility than that, since it considers the practicalities of moving from an existing contract with publishers for any reason.



ALT's journal has been renamed [Research in Learning Technology](http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/09687769.asp), and it will be fully Open Access as of January 2012. (Thanks to [Seb Schmoller](http://www.schmoller.net/) for the tip.)
