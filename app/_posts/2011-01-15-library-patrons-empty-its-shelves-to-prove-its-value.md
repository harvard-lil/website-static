[BoingBoing.net reports](http://www.boingboing.net/2011/01/14/threatened-library-g.html):

> The library in Stony Stratford near Milton Keynes, England, urged its patrons to check out every book on the shelves as a way of proving to the local council that its collection and facilities provide a vital service to the community. Stony Stratford is one of many towns across the UK that are facing severe library closures as the Tory-LibDem coalition government recklessly slashes its transfer payments to local governments (while breaking their promise to rein in enormous bonuses at the banks, even the ones that are owned by the taxpayer).

Let's just hope the local government doesn't look around the emptied library and think, "Yeah, great, I can really see how the new town road repair tool shed could fit in that corner labeled 'Classics,' and we could put the new town golf course's  pro shop over there by where the empty 'Science' shelves are..."
