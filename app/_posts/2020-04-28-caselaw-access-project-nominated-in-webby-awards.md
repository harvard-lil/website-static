The [Caselaw Access Project](https://case.law/) is nominated in the [24th Annual Webby Awards](https://www.webbyawards.com/)! 

We are a project from Harvard Law School Library making 6.7 million cases freely available online. We have developed new ways to read and view cases, from reading individual cases with the [CAP Case Browser](https://cite.case.law/), to seeing how words are used in opinions over time with [Historical Trends](https://case.law/trends/).
