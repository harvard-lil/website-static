From the [Pinakes](http://pinakes.org/whatispinakes.htm) page:

> Pinakes is a non-commercial tool the aim of which is to offer a renewed historiographic approach to the classification of the scientific heritage. Thanks to the integration of different types of objects, such as instruments, manuscripts, texts, iconography etc. Pinakes aims at transforming the traditional approach to the primary sources of the history of science into a sort of archeology of scientific knowledge. In order to achieve this ambitious project it was necessary to design a model of data-base, Pinakes, able to bring different classes of objects and items into one environment.

> Pinakes has been thought as a database capable of hosting different levels of data structuring. On the basis of the choiche of the target, the user might be able to manage data form a very specific level to a more general description of the items
classified.
