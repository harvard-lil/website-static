title: LIL Takes Toronto: the Creative Commons Summit 2018

The [Creative Commons Conference](https://summit.creativecommons.org/sessions2018/) in Toronto was wonderful this past weekend! It was a pleasure to meet the mix of artists, educators, civil servants, policymakers, journalists, and copyright agents (and more) who were there.

Talks touched on everything from how the Toronto Public Library manages their digital collections and engages their local cultural and tech communities with collections, to feminist theory and open access, to the state of copyright/open access worldwide. 

The range of stakeholders and interested parties involved with open access was greater than I realized. While I'm familiar with libraries and academics being interested in OA and OER, the number of government policymakers and artists who were there to learn and discuss was heartening.

Until next year, Creative Commons! And thank you, Ontario!
