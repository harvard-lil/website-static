The Association of College & Research Libraries's Planning and Review Committee has [posted](http://crln.acrl.org/content/71/6/286.short) what a February survey of the literature and of its members reveals as the top ten trends affecting libraries "now and in the near future." They list them in alphabetical order:


<blockquote>_Academic library collection growth is driven by patron demand and will include new resource types._

___Budget challenges will continue and libraries will evolve as a result._

_____Changes in higher education will require that librarians possess diverse skill sets._

_______Demands for accountability and assessment will increase._

_________Digitization of unique library collections will increase and require a larger share of resources._

___________Explosive growth of mobile devices and applications will drive new services._

_____________Increased collaboration will expand the role of the library within the institution and beyond._

_______________Libraries will continue to lead efforts to develop scholarly communication and intellectual property services_

_________________Technology will continue to change services and required skills._

___________________The definition of the library will change as physical space is repurposed and virtual space expands._</blockquote>


Hard to argue with anything on that list, beyond alphabetizing on the word "the" :) Some of the items seem to bury the lede a bit, though. For example, access to digitized, full-text sources shows up at the end of the first point on the list. Under that same point, "the effect of Google Books on library collections" shows up at the end in a comma-separated list of "additional collection development trends."

One point that the Lab is particularly interested in that didn't make it explicitly onto the list:  The rise in value of library metadata. There's tons of it around. It can be of incredible and continuing use to anyone trying to find or understand items in (or linked to) collections of all sorts. Library metadata is going to be big! Big, we tell you!
