Posted to the ASIS-L list by Susan Emilie Manus of the LOC:

The [Federal Agencies Digitization Guidelines Initiative](http://digitizationguidelines.gov) (FADGI) has just released a new planning document, [_Digitization Activities: Project Planning and Management Outline_](http://www.digitizationguidelines.gov/stillimages/documents/Planning.html).

The aim of this document is to define activities relating to the digitization of original cultural materials, and to outline general steps for planning and management of this process. The activities described in this document address library/archival issues, imaging and conversion work, and IT infrastructure issues in particular, and were identified using project management outlines from several organizations with significant experience working with cultural materials. This document defines "digitization" as a complete process, and covers all project components from content selection through delivery of digitized objects into a repository environment.
