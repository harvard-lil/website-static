[Doc Searls has a brief post](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/2010/11/13/the-world-live-library/) about wandering his way around the world and across the decades thanks to librarians, archivists, and the good folks of New Zealand.

Btw, be sure to click on the link to what Doc calls his "[favorite family photo of all time](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/2010/11/13/the-world-live-library/)."
