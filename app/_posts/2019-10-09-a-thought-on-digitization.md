Although it is excellent, and I recommend it very highly, 
I had not expected Roy Scranton's _Learning to Die in the
Anthropocene_ to shed light on the [Caselaw Access
Project](https://case.law/). Near the end of the book, he writes,

> The study of the humanities is nothing less than the patient
> nurturing of the roots and heirloom varietals of human symbolic
> life. This nurturing is a practice not strictly of curation, as many
> seem to think today, but of active attention, cultivation, making
> and remaking. It is not enough for the archive to be stored, mapped,
> or digitized. It must be _worked_.

The value of the Caselaw Access Project is not primarily in
preservation, saving space, or the abstraction of being
machine-readable; it is in its new _uses_, the making of things from
the raw material. We at LIL and others have begun to [make new
things](https://case.law/gallery/), but we're only at the
beginning. We hope you will join us, and surprise us.
