The Berkman  Center's [David O'Brien](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/dobrien), [Urs Gasser](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/ugasser/), and [John Palfrey](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/palfrey/) have just posted a 29-page "[briefing paper](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2111396)" on the various models and licenses by which libraries are providing access to e-books.

It's not just facts 'n' stats by any means, but here are some anyway:

> According to the 2011 Library Journal E-Book Survey, 82% of libraries currently offer access to e-books, which reflects an increase of 10 percentage points from 2010. ... Libraries maintain an average of 4,350 e-book copies in a collection.

> [T]he publisher-to-library market across all formats and all libraries (e.g., private, public, governmental, academic, research, etc.) is approximately $1.9B; of this, the market for public libraries is approximately $850M

> 92% of libraries use OverDrive as their  e-book dealer

> Of the major publishers, only Random House allows unrestricted lending of e-books.

I found the section on business models to be particularly clarifying.
