The future of the lab &mdash; I saw [Ivan Poupyrev](http://www.ivanpoupyrev.com/) talk about about the future of labs. He said a whole bunch of interesting things, but the thing stuck most with me is his advice on staffing a lab. He said something like "Bring in people that are focused on solving a problem. If they have a project you want to support and grow, bring them in and give them space to build that thing." Totally sold on this idea. Projects often need the stamina and focus of a single person (two people feels good too) to jam it through to success.

[Jllr](http://www.prokopbartonicek.com/jller-ignorance-with-benjamin-maus-2015) by Benjamin Maus, Prokop Bartoníček &mdash; A beautiful, relaxing, rock sorting machine. An instrument floats over the top of a bed of rocks looking at each one. After examination, it picks up a rock and moves it to a place in a grid of rocks sorted by geological age.

[Running Cola](http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O155000/running-cola-is-africa-print-kohmura-masao/) is Africa by Masao Kohmura, Fujino, Kouji, and Computer Technique Group &mdash; A classic piece of computer art from 1968. An algorithmic creation of frames starting with a running person, route through a bottle of cola, and end in the shape of the African continent.
