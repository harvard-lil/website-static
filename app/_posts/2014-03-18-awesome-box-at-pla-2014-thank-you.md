Thanks to everyone at [PLA 2014 in Indianapolis](http://www.placonference.org/) for making the Awesome Box feel welcome. We learned some things about public libraries and got to share the Awesome Box with a lot of people.

When we arrived at the exhibit hall it was a dash to get our booth setup. We tossed on the tablecloths, hung up our signage, and set up our sample books and boxes. We grabbed lunch and then began honing our carney-style Awesome Box pitch for the steady stream of library folk.

We pitched and pitched and pitched for two and half days. What a great way to get the selling points nailed down.

So many enthusiastic librarians, especially from Indiana, and so many helpful friends (Craig from [Cambridge Public Library](http://www.cambridgema.gov/cpl.aspx), Maura from [IMLS](http://www.imls.gov/), and Tim from [LibraryThing](https://www.librarything.com/)). Oh, and thanks to [TLC](http://www.tlcdelivers.com/) for giving us a ride to the airport.
