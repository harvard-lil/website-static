Today we're pleased to announce that North Carolina has joined Illinois, Arkansas, and New Mexico as the latest jurisdiction to make all of its [appellate court decisions](https://www.nccourts.gov/documents/appellate-court-opinions) openly available online, in an authoritative, machine-readable format that is citable using a vendor-neutral citation.

As a result of North Carolina taking this important step, the [Caselaw Access Project](https://case.law/) has removed all use and access restrictions from the North Carolina cases in its collection. You now can view or download the full text of all North Carolina cases without restriction. You can read individual cases with the [CAP Case Browser](https://cite.case.law/#nc) or access many cases at once with the [CAP API](https://case.law/api/) and [Bulk Data](https://case.law/bulk/download/). [Here's an example](https://cite.case.law/nc/1/1/12133083/)! 

We're delighted and inspired by the work of the North Carolina Supreme Court and the many dedicated professionals on the Court's staff. We hope that many other states will follow North Carolina’s example as soon as possible. [Here's how to help make it happen](https://case.law/action/).
