[dpBestflow](http://dpbestflow.org/) is a new site that is a cooperative venture between the Library of Congress and the American Society of Digital Photographers---just launched on Nov 11. It includes everything you want to know about digital photography---from the camera settings to the archival format choices etc.  It was funded under LC's National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program. Looks to be a really great resource.
