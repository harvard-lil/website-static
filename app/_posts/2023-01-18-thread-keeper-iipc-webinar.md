I was invited by the [International Internet Preservation Consortium (IIPC)](https://netpreserve.org/) 
to give a webinar on the topic of _"Archiving Twitter"_ on January 12.

During this talk, I presented what we've learned building [thread-keeper](/sketches/thread-keeper/), the experimental open-source software behind [social.perma.cc](https://social.perma.cc) which allows for making high-fidelity captures of twitter.com urls as _"sealed"_ PDFs.
