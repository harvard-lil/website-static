Friend of the Library Peter Suber has posted his [year-end round](http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/newsletter/01-02-11.htm#2010) up of what's happened with Open Access. It's a massive record--—Peter acknowledges at the outset that there's too much happening for a full acounting--—but in section 10 there's some highlights and lowlights.

There is a _lot_ going on--—much of it quite good.
