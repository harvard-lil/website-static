title: "Caselaw Access Project: Summer 2019 Data Release"
author: kelly-fitzpatrick

Today we’re announcing a new data release for the [Caselaw Access Project](https://case.law/). This update includes:

* In-text figures and illustrations in cases. An example, from *[Sussman v. Cooper ](https://cite.case.law/f2d/537/531/)*(1976), is below. 
* Inline page numbers. You can provide a pin cite to a specific page in a case by adding `#p123` to the URL, or just by clicking the page number.
* Italic formatting in case text, as detected by OCR.

See what this all looks like in practice with [an example](https://cite.case.law/f2d/537/531/#p532).

All of this additional data is available programmatically as well, by downloading our bulk data releases or requesting `body_format=html` from our API.

This data release develops how we view and share the published U.S. caselaw made available by the Caselaw Access Project. Let us know how you’re creating new ways to see this data at [info@case.law](mailto:info@case.law)!
