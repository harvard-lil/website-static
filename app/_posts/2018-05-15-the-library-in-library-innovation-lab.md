A roomful of people sitting in armchairs with laptops may not appear
at first glance to be a place where library work is happening. It
could look more like a tech startup, or maybe a student lounge (modulo
the ages of some of the people in the armchairs). You don't have to be
a librarian to see it, but, as the only librarian presently working at
LIL, I'll try to show how LIL's work is at the heart of librarianship.

Of our main projects, the
__[Nuremberg project](https://lil.law.harvard.edu/projects/nuremberg-project/)__
is the closest to a notion of traditional library work: scanning,
optical character recognition, and metadata creation for trial
documents and transcripts from the Nuremberg Military Tribunals, a
collection of enormous historical interest. This is squarely in the
realm of library collections, preservation, and access.

In its broad outline, the work on Nuremberg is similar to that of the
__[Caselaw Access Project](https://lil.law.harvard.edu/projects/caselaw-access-project/)__,
the digitization of all U.S. case law. This project, however, is what
Jonathan Zittrain has referred to as a systemic intervention. By
making the law freely accessible online, we are not only going to
alter the form of and access to the print collection, but we are going
to transform the relationships of libraries, lawyers, courts,
scholars, and citizens to the law. By freeing the law for a multitude
of uses, the Caselaw Access Project will support efforts like
__[H2O](https://lil.law.harvard.edu/projects/h2o/)__, LIL's free
casebook platform, another intervention into the field of publishing.

Over the last forty years or so, as computers have become more and
more essential to library work, libraries have ceded control to
vendors. For example, not only does a library subscribing to an online
journal database lose the ability to make collection development
decisions autonomously (though [LOCKSS](https://www.lockss.org/), a
distributed preservation system, helps address this), but, in
relinquishing control of the platform, it relinquishes the power to
protect [patron confidentiality](http://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/librarybill/interpretations/privacy), and consequently intellectual freedom.

__[Perma.cc](https://lil.law.harvard.edu/projects/perma-cc/)__ is an
intervention of a different sort, a tool to combat
[link rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot). As a means of
permanently archiving web links, it's close to libraries' preservation
efforts, but the point of action is generally the author or editor of
a document, not an archivist, post-publication. Further, Perma's
reliability rests on the authority of the library to maintain
collections in perpetuity.

As library work, these interventions are radical, in the sense of
at-the-root: they address core activities of the library, they engage
long-standing problems in librarianship, and they expand on and
distribute traditional library work.
