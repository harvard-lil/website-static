I'm not just carelessly using the Royal We when I say that we're loving Dave Pattern's blog. He's the Library Systems Manager at University of Huddersfield, and he's deep into slicing and dicing library usage metadata. For [example](http://www.daveyp.com/blog/archives/1370), [example](http://www.daveyp.com/blog/archives/1385), and another [example](http://www.daveyp.com/blog/archives/1432). And don't forget this [Library 2.0 idea generator](http://www.daveyp.com/blog/archives/106). (Thanks, Jeff, for the links.)
