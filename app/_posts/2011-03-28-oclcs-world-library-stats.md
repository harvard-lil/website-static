OCLC has posted a [page](http://www.oclc.org/globallibrarystats/default.htm) that lets you drill down by geographic area to see stats about libraries. For example, Massachusetts has 3,181 librarians (1,440 of which are in academic libraries) and 81,877,061 volumes in libraries. (Hat tip to [Infodocket](http://infodocket.com/2011/03/25/new-from-oclc-libraryoclc-researcha-global-library-statistics-web-page/).)
