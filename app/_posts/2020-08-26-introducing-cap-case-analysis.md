We’re announcing a new layer of information in the [Caselaw Access Project](https://case.law/).

Among [seven new data fields](https://case.law/api/#analysis-fields) are PageRank, the all-time significance of a case based on our [citation graph](https://case.law/download/citation_graph/), and Cardinality, the number of unique words in a case. These and other fields derived from case text allow us to do things like identifying the longest court opinion ever published, or investigating how language in cases has changed over time. You can view analysis fields in the sidebar when [browsing](https://cite.case.law/f-supp/32/817/) or [via the API](https://api.case.law/v1/cases/4194497/).

We want to hear about what you’ve learned and created using these fields. [Let us know](https://case.law/contact/)!
