Here is a letter from our very own Paul Deschner, to the Harvard Library community (and---now---beyond).  It was so well received here that we thought it worth sharing more broadly.

> Hi all,
>
> During this time of general re-evaluation of library services, I thought
> it might be helpful to share a few thoughts from my vantage point as a
> software developer at the Harvard Library Innovation Lab regarding the
> relationship between our catalogers (we're in the Law Library) and the
> data they create and software development for library applications.
>
> My project work at the Lab has time and again shown the crucial
> importance not simply of cataloged records, but of cataloged records
> created to a high standard.  I work primarily on data platforms,
> harvesting bibliographic and related data and making it accessible to
> other developers who create amazing tools and services for library
> communities.
>
> One of the primary challenges in this work is getting data describing
> books and periodicals (catalog records) to relate to data from
> non-library sources, such as data about book talks on YouTube or to NPR
> broadcasts of author interviews or to archival collections.  It's all
> about connections in the data.  The barer the data, the less described
> it is, the more it falls flat.
>
> On the bibliographic side, every new Library of Congress subject heading
> a cataloger adds to a record creates a rich set of connective
> possibilities downstream for people like me.  Likewise, every uniform
> title entry inserted into a record allows us to show users of our
> software another edition of a given work in the context of all its
> editions -- a crucial feature for any discovery service in the library
> materials space.
>
> No software can create these connections if the underlying data hasn't
> been carefully composed into richly structured records, based on solid
> analysis and comprehensive description.  The difference is like that
> between reading a newspaper consisting of headlines only and reading one
> which also has accompanying articles.  It is dramatic.
>
> I hope in moving forward that we don't lose sight of the importance of
> this kind of quality analysis and description.
>
> But also: the expertise which catalogers bring to the task of
> comprehensive bibliographic description has proven crucial to me as a
> reference resource in my work of designing software to harvest and
> process bibliographic information.  At the Law Library, the catalogers
> are a few hallway steps away, and are as crucial to my being able to
> create smart software as anyone on my development team.  I've spent
> countless hours, regularly throughout the years, with my cataloger
> colleagues exploring the complexities of MARC data structures, uniform
> title rulesets, authority record uses, holdings data locations, and much
> much more.  Having them as a co-located resource has been crucial to my
> being able to get my software written.
>
> There are some amazing cross-departmental symbioses here in the Harvard
> Library, as well as some crucial, perhaps non-obvious, dependencies
> between departments.  From where I'm sitting, they comprise a major,
> wonderfully effect part of our current ecosystem.
