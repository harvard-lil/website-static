This March, Sidsel Bech-Petersen a Library Transformer at [Aarhus Public Libraries](https://www.aakb.dk/in-english) and I have proposed a session at South By Southwest Interactive.  It's called [Library Machines](http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/19336), and essentially, it's a discussion/workshop to explore new ideas and directions for libraries.  It will be the spiritual sibling of last year's [Libraries: the Ultimate Playground](http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/2696).

During the Library Machines session, we'll all go through a quick, ["mad libs" style design exercise](http://librarytestkitchen.org/assets/Librarian-Created-Machines.pdf), and use that as a jumping off point for a larger discussion through the rest of the session.

1) If you're going to be at SXSW, join us! this will be a discussion and making session, not a presentation

2) If all goes according to plan, outside this session we should be facilitating a bunch of library "innovation"-y fun stuff so reach out if you're interested in helping!  (jgoldenson AT law.harvard.edu)

[Give it a thumbs up, a tweet and if inspired, make an Library Machine in the comments!  ](http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/19336)
