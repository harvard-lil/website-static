Stephen Ramsay has [blogged a terrific talk](http://lenz.unl.edu/wordpress/?p=266) he gave at Emory University about ending the relatively recent separation between librarians and scholars (and students). The talk reflects Stephen's thinking about Emory's [Digital Scholarly Commons](http://web.library.emory.edu/Digital_Scholarship_Commons) project.
