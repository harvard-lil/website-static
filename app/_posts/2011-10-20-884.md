The [Association of College and Research Libraries](http://www.acrl.org) has signed the [Berlin Declaration](http://oa.mpg.de/lang/en-uk/berlin-prozess/berliner-erklarung/). The ACRL is a division of the [American Library Association](http://www.ala.org), and has 12,500 members (which is about [20%](http://www.acrl.org/ala/mgrps/divs/acrl/about/whatisacrl/index.cfm) of the ALA's membership). The Berlin Declaration was written in 2003 and encourages open access publishing.
