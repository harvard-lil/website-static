Group hug at [github](https://github.com/organizations/harvard-lil).

We've been loving github lately. We used to manage our own Git repositories on a local development server, then we saw the glowing beacon that is github. We ran to it and we haven't looked back.

Code management is as good as it gets. Project management is pleasant too thanks to [github issues.](https://github.com/blog/831-issues-2-0-the-next-generation)

Please have a look around [our home on github, http://github.com/harvard-lil](https://github.com/organizations/harvard-lil). And don't just look, hop in: fork projects you're interested in -> fix bugs and make enhancements -> send us pull requests
