Wikipedia is looking for volunteers to answer some questions as they try to understand why researchers and experts do and do not contribute to Wikipedia. From the email they've sent around:

> Wikipedia is increasingly used by university students for "pre-research", to gain context and explore ideas for course assignments and research projects [1]. Yet many among scientists, academics and other experts are reluctant to contribute to Wikipedia, despite a growing number of calls from the scientific community to join the project [2--3].
>
> The Wikimedia Research Committee [4] has just launched a survey to understand why scientists, academics and other experts do (or do not) contribute to Wikipedia and other collaborative projects, and whether individual motivation aligns with shared perceptions of Wikipedia within expert communities. We hope this may help us identify ways around barriers to expert participation. The survey is anonymous and takes about 20 min to complete. Please help us circulate the link among your colleagues and collaborators:
