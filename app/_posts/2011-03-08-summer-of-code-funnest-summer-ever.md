\[Update (March 19)]: Google turned down the Berkman Center application, which included our projects :( \]

We've put in for a couple of Summer of Code [projects](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/gsoc/Library_Innovation_Lab), in conjunction with the Berkman Center:

> 1\. Syllabus parser. Design, structure and populate an open repository of the information in college syllabi.
>
>   * Assuming we get permission, figure out how to retrieve syllabi from Google. (If we don't get permission, we have a starter set of 500,000+ syllabi.)
>
>   * Figure out how to parse the multiple and free-form formats syllabi are found in.
>
>   * Design an appropriate and open data model for the information in syllabi.
>
>   * Build a Web site with that provides useful end-user and API access to the syllabus data.
>
> 2\. Scholarly semantic web builder. The aim is to crawl the Google Books corpus looking for useful relationships among scholarly works. Such relationships only begin with citations/footnotes. What other semantic cues can be unearthed to see how scholarly books relate?
>
>   * Research the sorts of relations between books that would be of high value to scholars and researchers, in addition to footnotes.
>
>   * Crawl the Google Books corpus to discover these relations [if Google grants permission].
>
>   * Make these relations accessible in an open way, especially in conjunction with the ShelfLife app that provides community-based wayfaring through Harvard Library's holdings for scholars and researchers.
>
>   * Create interesting and understandable analytics based on the discovered relationships.
>

We're now waiting to see if the proposals get accepted.

The rest of the Berkman proposals---many fun ones---are [here](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/gsoc/Main_Page).
