The Caselaw Access Project is taking its first steps to create links to case citations in our collection of 6.7 million cases.

This update makes case citations available as links in the [CAP case browser](https://cite.case.law/). When [viewing a case](https://cite.case.law/f2d/573/657/), citations are shown as links.

When you click on a citation, you’ll go directly to that case.

We also created a `cites_to` field in the [Caselaw Access Project API](https://case.law/api/). This new field shows which cases an opinion cites to. [Here’s what that looks like](https://api.case.law/v1/cases/913920/?full_case=true).

This is only the beginning of our work with case citations. In the future, we hope to improve citation extraction and ultimately to offer researchers a citation graph.
