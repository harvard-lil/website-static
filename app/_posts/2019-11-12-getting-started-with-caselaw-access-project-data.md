Today we’re sharing new ways to get started with [Caselaw Access Project](https://case.law/) data using tutorials from [The Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/) and more. 

The Caselaw Access Project makes 360 years of U.S. case law available as a machine-readable text corpus. In developing a research community around the dataset, we’ve been creating and sharing resources for getting started.

In our gallery, we’ve been developing [tutorials](https://case.law/gallery/#tutorials) and our [examples repository](https://github.com/harvard-lil/cap-examples) for working with our data alongside [research results](https://case.law/gallery/#research-results), [applications](https://case.law/gallery/#applications), [fun stuff](https://case.law/gallery/#fun-stuff), and [more](https://case.law/gallery/):

[The Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/) shares peer-reviewed tutorials for computational workflows in the humanities. Here are a group of their guides for working with text data, from processing to analysis:

* [Cleaning Data with OpenRefine](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/cleaning-data-with-openrefine)
* [Reshaping JSON with jq](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/json-and-jq)
* [Basic Text Processing in R](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/basic-text-processing-in-r)
* [Getting Started with Topic Modeling and MALLET](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/topic-modeling-and-mallet)
* [Corpus Analysis with Antconc](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/corpus-analysis-with-antconc)
* [Analyzing Documents with TF-IDF](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/analyzing-documents-with-tfidf)
	
We want to share and build ways to start working with Caselaw Access Project data. Do you have an idea for a future tutorial? [Drop us a line](https://case.law/contact/) to let us know!
