I've been playing with physical pitch decks lately. Slides as printed cards.

PowerPoint, [Deck.js](http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/), and the like are fantastic when sharing with large groups of people — from a classroom full of folks to a web full of folks. But, what if easy and broad sharing isn't a criteria for your pitch deck?

You might end up with physical cards like I did when I recently pitched [Private Talking Spaces]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/2016/09/02/private-talking-spaces-progress/). The cards are surprisingly good!! Just like non-physical slides, they can provide outlines for talks and discussions, but they're so simple (just paper and ink), they won't get in the way when sharing ideas with small groups.

The operation of the cards is as plain as can be - just take the card off the top, flip it upside down, and put it to the side.

n cards = n screens in the world of physical pitch decks. I wish we had multiple projectors in rooms! In the photo above, I pin my agenda card up top.

I drew the slides in Adobe Illustrator. They're six inches square and printed on sturdy paper. If you'd like to make your own, here's [my .ai file](https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/pts-pitch.ai) and here's [a .pdf version](https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/pts-pitch.pdf).

It feels like there's something here. Some depth. If you've had success with physical pitch decks, please [send me pointers](mailto:mphillips@law.harvard.edu). Thanks!!
