author: kelly-fitzpatrick

The [Caselaw Access Project](https://case.law/) is now sharing a citation graph of the 6.7 million cases in our collection from Harvard Law School Library. This update makes available a CSV file that lists case IDs and the cases they cite to. Here’s where you can find it: [case.law/download/citation_graph](https://case.law/download/citation_graph/)

This citation graph shows us how cases are connected; it lets us find relationships between cases, like identifying the most influential cases and jurisdictions. This update is a new resource for finding those patterns. In the future, we want to use the CAP citation graph to create visualizations to show these relationships. We’re excited for you to do the same. 

Have something to share? Send it our way! [We’re looking forward to hearing from you](https://case.law/contact/).
