Fred Wilson's [10 Golden Principles of Successful Web Apps](http://carsonified.com/blog/business/fred-wilsons-10-golden-principles-of-successful-web-apps/)
(He's at [Union Square Ventures](http://www.unionsquareventures.com/index.php) and has a blog)  This is a summary of the talk he gave at [Future of Web Apps](http://futureofwebapps.com/) Conference

**Speed** --- it just has to work _fast_

**Instant Utility** ---

**Voice** --- attitude, style, personality, you should feel like your consuming media (CNN, Fox News) when you're interacting

**Less Is More** --- Great services are simple.  Example: delicious (which drives our "what we're reading" section).  You can do very little but still be powerful.

**Programmable** --- APIs, read/write APIs, Absolutely essential to let others contribute functionality to your application.

**Personal** --- Avatars, Backgrounds, UGC, so people can feel ownership

**"RESTful"** --- Everything in the application has a url.  And the url has clean and understandable path.   This way the web can access your app in deep ways.  Build on an open architecture.

**Discoverable** --- Build from the ground up to be discoverable through google, but also through Social Media.  Build from the ground up to be viral.  So it can push itself.

**Clean** --- The app has to be simple visually, not busy on the page.  Lots of space.  Big fonts.  Not too much functionality per page.  Very inviting.  [Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com) is a great example  you just know what to do.

**Playful** --- Have fun.  The ability to play in an application.  Foster a game dynamic.  Like Weight watchers, you establish goals, you get points and report against goals, you meet goals and are rewarded.
