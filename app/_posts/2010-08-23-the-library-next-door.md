According to an [article in the Minneapolis Star Tribune](http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/homegarden/101181499.html), a St. Louis Park couple had so many books that they bought the house next door and turned it into their own library.

The article doesn't tell us how many books they own, but a reasonable [guess](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_e-book_formats) might be, oh, 200 gigabytes worth.
