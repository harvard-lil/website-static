We've created an embeddable widget for the Awesome Box. This widget allows Awesome Box members to share items that have been awesomed without forcing their patrons to visit the Awesome Box site.

Here's an example of the embedded widget:

<script src="http://lil.awesomebox.io/widget/"></script>

This is cool in a blog post and would be so much cooler on your library's site.

If you're interested in becoming an Awesome Box partner and geting your own Awesome Box widget, let us know at [http://awesomebox.io](http://awesomebox.io)
