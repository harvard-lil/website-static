A friend of my son at Brown showed him a note tucked inside a book on the history of Russian anarchism:
![Department of Homeland Security warning - an activist hoax](https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2010/12/dhs-unsafe-book.jpg)

It turns out to be a [hoax](http://ultraviolet.in/2009/06/30/the-fear-of-feminism/) played by some activists---all too believably.
