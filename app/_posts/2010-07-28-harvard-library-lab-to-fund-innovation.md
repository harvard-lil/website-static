Harvard has [announced](http://osc.hul.harvard.edu/liblab) the creation of the Harvard Library Lab:

> The Lab promotes the development of projects in all areas of library activity and leverages the entrepreneurial aspirations of people throughout the library system and beyond. Proposals from faculty and students from anywhere in the university will also be welcomed and the Lab will encourage collaboration with projects being developed at MIT.

This is great news, both in its practical import and as yet another sign of Harvard's desire to innovate to help make libraries more useful,  valuable, and relevant than ever. Thanks to the [Arcadia Fund](http://www.arcadiafund.org.uk/content/default.asp) for supporting this. (Our own [John Palfrey](blogs.law.harvard.edu/palfrey/) is one of the members of the new Library Lab. Yay!)

In other news, it looks like our little library lab is going to be changing its name 🙂
