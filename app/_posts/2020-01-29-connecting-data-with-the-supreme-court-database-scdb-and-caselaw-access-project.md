Connection can help us do new things. That’s why we’re excited to announce that we’ve made a match for over 99% of cases in the [Supreme Court Database (SCDB)](http://scdb.wustl.edu/) to the [Caselaw Access Project](https://case.law/). 

The Supreme Court Database (SCDB) is a data source connecting U.S. Supreme Court cases with resources about those decisions. Those resources, ranging from docket numbers to information about a decision, help build a richer picture of the judicial landscape.

By joining the Caselaw Access Project with data made available by the Supreme Court Database (SCDB), we were able to find matches for 28,090 out of 28,347 of those cases. This development connects metadata from the Supreme Court Database (SCDB) with the Caselaw Access Project which lets us do things like add additional parallel citations to all of the matched cases, and search cases by Supreme Court Database (SCDB) ID and citation. [Here’s an example](https://case.law/search/#/cases?page=1&cite=SCDB%201946-001)! 

This update makes learning new things about law in the United States easier to achieve; from finding patterns the judicial history of cases and decisions, to what the contents of those cases look like. By connecting the Caselaw Access Project and the Supreme Court Database (SCDB), we want to enable new ways to learn, build, and support access to the law. [Let us know](https://case.law/contact/) how you’re making that happen.
