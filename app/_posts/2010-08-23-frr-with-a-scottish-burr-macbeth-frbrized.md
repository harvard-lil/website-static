Peter Sime has posted an [11-slide deck](http://www.slideshare.net/DescribeNZ/frrr-brrr-scottish-play) that explains FRBR with Macbeth as his example. (FRBR is a way of expressing the sometimes complex relationships among the Platonic form of the book and all its various manifestations.) (via the [frbr blog](http://www.frbr.org/))
