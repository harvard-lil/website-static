This is an olde post, that I'm coming back to, and adding onto.  Two interesting uses of twitter:

**1)  Twitter as Subject Stream:** Over on techcrunch there's a [post](http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/09/why-is-quora-mass-creating-twitter-accounts-on-mechanical-turk/) about how [Quora](http://www.quora.com/) is using Mechanical Turk to automate the creation of twitter accounts.  Quora is a mass  Q & A website for anything.  You ask a question: "Where's the best  place to crowdsource an icon?", and you get a response, for example from user alton  sun :"[99designs.com....](http://99designs.com/)".

Quora the site is organized into many subject areas which you can subscribe to (UI, Startups etc.).  They are creating a twitter account for each of these subject areas, so those interested Quora users can subscribe to the feed and get the newest message from that subject area.  It's cool.

**2) Twitter with a [High-Pass Filter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highpass_filter):** This is the newer part of the post, [Jeff Miller](http://about.me/jeffmiller), has created a twitter feed that broadcasts Hacker News stories when they reach a certain point value.  [http://twitter.com/newsyc100](http://twitter.com/newsyc100) was the first one I noticed, it broadcasts stories once they reach 100pts.  But it seems he also set a feed with 2opt, 50pt and 150pt triggers.  I really like the idea that once something has reached a level of community interesting-ness---as manifest in points---you can grant Hacker News the ability to become a verb and reach out and tell YOU about it.

You can decide that anything that is of _n_ interestesting-ness to a community is of interest to me.
