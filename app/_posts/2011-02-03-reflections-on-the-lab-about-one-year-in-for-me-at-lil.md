title: Reflections on the Lab (about one year in for me at LIL)

A couple months back on the airplane, I made a version of this list.  Some loose observations/questions about the Lab, what we've been focusing on, what we could be looking at...

1. **Measuring success**---What constitutes a successful project?  What is our (LIL) metric?

2. **Off-line innovation**---We're focusing on software & data, how can we expand our scope offline?

3. **Voyeurism sells**---Our most successful endeavors (as measured by eliciting a response [IMO]) have pulled back the curtain, allowing people to "see in" the library. People are curious, how can we leverage this voyeurism to make great projects?

4. **See our assets with fresh eyes**---Libraries have several amazing assets to leverage for innovation (that start-ups could only dream of):
    <br>
    - _central location_---public libraries, private ones, academic - libraries are always sited at the heart of everything

    - _librarians_---an interested community, a live and in-person customer support staff

    - _strong user base_---a community of patrons

    - _transaction data_---we can still identify trends, learn about the community while respecting privacy

    - _trust_---people trust libraries and librarians as purveyors

    - _inventory_---stuff (books, dvds, mags, kindles?) people want, for "free trial"

5. **The Library experience**---Libraries, in general, have looked the same for quite a while.  The experience visiting a library, the services provided, the look hasn't changed too much.  What would the most far-out, radical library be?

6. **Future**---The future of the library is not the future of the book.  But how is it not?

7. **A culture of innovation**---How can we, as a Lab, both advance large projects, while also pursuing smaller ideas and experiments?
