The Twitter hashtag [#FailShare](http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23failshare) is accumulating instances of failed library projects, so that we can learn from them, and also, I imagine, to take the sting out of failure (on the grounds that sting-y failure makes for stingy ideas).

And, a brand new [wiki page](http://failbrary.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) has gone up on the same topic.
