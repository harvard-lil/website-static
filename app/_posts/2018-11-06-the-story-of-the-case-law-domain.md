Recently we [announced](https://lil.law.harvard.edu/blog/2018/10/29/caselaw-access-project-cap-launches-api-and-bulk-data-service/) the launch of the Caselaw Access Project at [case.law](https://case.law/). But we want to highlight the story of the case.law domain itself.

That domain was generously provided by Carl Jaeckel, its previous owner. Carl agreed to transfer the domain to us in recognition and support of the vital public interest in providing free, open access to caselaw. We’re thrilled to have such a perfect home for the project.

Carl is the managing partner of [Jaeckel Law](https://www.jaeckellaw.com/), the Founder of [ClassAction.org](https://www.classaction.org/), and the Chief Operating Officer of [Dot Law Inc](https://join.law/). We can’t wait to see what he and other legal entrepreneurs, researchers, and developers will build based on case.law.
