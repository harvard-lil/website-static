So "Future of the Book" was just put out by [IDEO](http://www.ideo.com).

<div class="embed-container"><iframe title="The Future of the Book" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/15142335" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

[The Future of the Book.](http://vimeo.com/15142335) from [IDEO](http://vimeo.com/ideo) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).

Here's an article about it:

It's interesting, IDEO is obviously very on it.  I don't think there is anything that is absolutely relevant to us, but it is worth viewing.

What it does make me think of is the necessity to begin really trying to work out "The Future of Libraries".

I think we as a Lab need to define our mission in the context of a vision of the future.
