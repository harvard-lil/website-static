The CAP case browser is a way to browse 6.7 million cases digitized from the collections of the Harvard Law School Library.

## Retrieve Case by Citation: Brown v. Board of Education

1. Find the citation of a case you want to retrieve. Let’s start with *Brown v. Board of Education*: **Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954)**.

2. In the citation, [find the case reporter, volume, and page](https://www.bc.edu/content/dam/files/schools/law_sites/library/pdf/researchguides/citations.pdf): Brown v. Board of Education, **347 U.S. 483** (1954).

3. We’re going to create our URL using this template: `cite.case.law/<reporter>/<volume>/<page>`

4. In the reporter, volume, and page fields, add the information for the case you want to retrieve. Your URL for *Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954)* should look like this: **cite.case.law/us/347/483/**

5. Let’s try it out!  Add the URL you’ve just created to your browser’s search bar, and press Enter.
