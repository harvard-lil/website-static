Felix Online, the online news of [Imperial College](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/) in the UK, [reports](http://www.felixonline.co.uk/?article=808) (in an article by Kadhim Shubber) that Deborah Shorley, Director of the Imperial College London Library, is threatening to end the library's subscriptions to journals published by [Elsevier](http://www.Elsevier.com) and [Wiley Blackwell](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/Brand/id-35.html), two of the major publishers in the UK. Upset with 6% increases in annual subscription fees (well above inflation, and in the face of a growth in profits at Elsevier  from £1B to £1.6B from 2005 to 2009), she is demanding a 15% reduction in fees, as well as other concessions.

Says the article: "...if an agreement or an alternative delivery plan is not in place by January 2nd next year, researchers at Imperial and elsewhere will lose access to thousands of journals. But Deborah Shorley is determined to take it to the edge if necessary: 'I will not blink.'"

As the article mentions, in 2010, after a 300-400% fee increase, the University of California [threatened to boycott](http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2010/06/university-of-california-conside.html) the Nature Publishing Group, including not engaging in peer review for NPG's journals. (NPG claims that the rise in fees was due to the reduction of a discount from 88% to 50%. UC [disputes](http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/University%20of%20California%20Response%20to%20Nature%20Publishing%20Group.pdf) this.) In August of 2010, NPG and UC came to  [announced](http://content.usatoday.com/communities/sciencefair/post/2010/08/university-of-california-scientists-wont-be-boycotting-nature/1) "an agreement to work together to address the current licensing challenges as well as the larger issues of sustainability in the scholarly communication process."
