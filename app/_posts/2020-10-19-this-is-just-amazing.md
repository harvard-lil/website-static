The other day, I noticed this on the side of the house.

That is near the bottom of the run of [Cat
5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_5_cable) Ethernet cable I
installed over twenty years ago, from the cable modem and router in
the basement through a window frame, up the side of the house and into
the third floor through another hole in a window frame. What I found
amazing was not so much that the cable, neither shielded nor rated for
the out-of-doors, had lasted so long in such an amateurish
installation, but that all of our Zoom meetings for the last eight
months had passed through these little wires.

The really amazing part, beyond the near-magic of all that audio and
video flying through little twists of copper, is the depth of
dependency: at each end of that cable is hardware that changes
voltages on the wires, operating system drivers for interacting with
the hardware, the networking stacks of the operating systems that
offer network interfaces to software, the software itself, the systems
of authentication and authorization that the software uses to permit
or deny access---a cascade of protocols, standards, devices,
programming languages, and codebases that become the (mostly) seamless
experience of the discussion we have at ten each morning. Or, a moment
later, the experience of confirming that the city has accepted the
ballot I mailed.

Starry-eyed delight in an amazing machine is clearly not sufficient,
with as good a view as we now have of the broken dream of a liberatory
Internet. We have to have an acute awareness of the [system
accidents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_accident) implicit in
our tools and the societal technologies that are connected to them. I
believe the delight is necessary, though---without it, I don't see how
we can ever learn to treat computers as anything other than an
apparatus of control. There's hope, if a grimy cable with a broken
jacket can carry joy.
