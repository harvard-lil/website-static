Today we’re announcing the [CAP case browser](https://cite.case.law/)! Browse published U.S. case law from 1658 to 2018&mdash;all 40 million pages of it.

The CAP case browser is one way to browse and cite cases made available via the [Caselaw Access Project API](https://case.law/api/). The [Caselaw Access Project](https://case.law/) shares cases digitized from the collections of the Harvard Law School Library.
