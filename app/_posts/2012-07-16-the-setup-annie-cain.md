title: The Setup – Annie Cain

**Who are you, and what do you do?**

I'm Annie Cain.  I was once a librarian and maybe still am.  Either way, I currently build web apps.  For libraries.  I also come up with ideas, help shape ideas and help execute & build non-web ideas.

**What hardware do you use?**

My work machine is a [giant Mac Pro](http://www.apple.com/macpro/).  Sometimes I bump my knee on it.  A big-enough Acer monitor is connected to it.  I use a [Magic Mouse](http://www.apple.com/magicmouse/) because the cord was cramping my style.  My folding [Sennheiser headphones](http://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-PX-100-Lightweight-Collapsible/dp/B000089GN3) are not audiophile approved, but they suit me just fine.

At home I have a MacBook Air.  I think I'm the only one in the world who despises the MacBook Air.

When I go to meetings, I generally bring a [Rhodia notebook](http://rhodiapads.com/) and [Zebra pen](http://www.zebrapen.com/products/pen/f-301?c=30) along.  More often than not I also have a snack and the [cheapest clear mug I cound find in Harvard Square](http://www.tealuxe.com/component/page,shop.product_details/flypage,tealuxe-hg-flypage.tpl/product_id,606/category_id,24/option,com_virtuemart/Itemid,1/), filled with water or tea.  I live in fear that Republic of Tea will stop selling their [Passion Fruit Papaya blend](http://www.republicoftea.com/passionfruit-papaya-black/p/V00589/).

Sometimes I use my window as a refrigerator.  I can fit a sandwich between the two panes of glass.

**And what software?**

[MagiCal](http://www.charcoaldesign.co.uk/magical) is the first thing I install on a new Mac.

I constantly use [Exposé](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2503) to find buried windows and access the desktop.

When working directly on the development server (which is all the time, scandalous!), I type code in [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) and push images up with [Transmit](http://panic.com/transmit/).  When I'm not feeling up to typing SQL in the Terminal (which is most of the time, scandalous!), I use [Sequel Pro](http://www.sequelpro.com/) to interact with MySQL.

I use Firefox when web developing.  Firebug provides most of what I need to understand what's going on.  [MeasureIt](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/measureit/) and [JSONView](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/jsonview/) also help.  Heck, I still use some features of the [Web Developer extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-developer/).  For my general browsing and [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader/) perusing, I use Chrome.  I go to [Byliner](http://byliner.com/) if I need a longer reading break.

Photoshop is the only one of the Suite that I know how to operate, so it's the hammer for all of my graphics nails.

We're not afraid to share our stuff on [GitHub](https://github.com/harvard-lil).  It's also super handy for collaboration and tracking code & issues.

**What would be your dream setup?**

Better lighting would probably get me a lot closer to a dream setup.  Ideally I'd work on a laptop.  Maybe connect it to a bigger monitor sometimes.  It would definitely have an SD card slot.

A refrigerator would be nice as my window doesn't stay cool in the summer.  A mug warmer to keep my tea steamy would also be super.
