We've entered the [DPLA](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/research/dpla)'s "[beta sprint](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/dpla/)," along with [thirteen fantastic partners](https://web.archive.org/web/20160413203820/http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/dpla/#partners) (so far)!

The idea behind the beta sprint is that anyone with an idea about what the DPLA should be, how it should work, what it can do, or what it should look like should embody that idea in code or documentation, and submit it by September 1.

We're proposing a version of [ShelfLife]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects#shelflife-io) re-thought for a  potentially massive set of users whose interests and computer skills range all over the lot. And we're proposing [LibraryCloud]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects#library-cloud) as a middleware metadata server both to support ShelfLife and to make DPLA's metadata available through open APIs and as Linked Open Data.

We've put up a [page about our collaborative project](https://web.archive.org/web/20160413203820/http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/dpla/), including our 400-word proposal to the DPLA. We'd love to hear from you.
