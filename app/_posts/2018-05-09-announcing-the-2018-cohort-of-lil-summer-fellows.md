Each summer brings to LIL a new cohort of Summer Fellows to inspire and challenge us with their visions of what libraries make possible. 

Over the past two summers, we've learned with and from these colleagues about building online collections of [local news stories](http://www.localmemory.org/) (Alexander Nwala), connecting citizens of Nigeria with information about [human rights law](https://law2go.org/about/) (Jake Effoduh), exploring the [Guantanamo Detainee Library](https://www.kenyonreview.org/kr-online-issue/2015-summer/selections/detainee-library-guantanamo/) (Muira McCammon), creating [high fidelity web archives](https://webrecorder.io/) (Ilya Kreymer), [imagining Palestine-Israel through maps](https://zenaagha.com/projects/mapping-palestine-israel/) (Zena Agha) and many other things (more about our previous cohorts [here](https://lil.law.harvard.edu/collaborate/2016/summer/fellows/), [here](https://library.harvard.edu/09192017-0950/creating-new-tools-libraries) and [here](https://library.harvard.edu/10022017-1134/discoveries-harvard-library-innovation-lab)).  

Next month, we'll welcome eight new Summer Fellows to LIL:

We invited these eight explorers to join us after reviewing over 120 applications and conducting roughly 60 interviews, including multiple interviews with all of the finalists.  This year's applicant pool amazed and challenged us, and we are so grateful to everyone who applied and who helped spread the word about the opportunity. Thank you!
