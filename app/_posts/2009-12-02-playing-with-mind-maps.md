Another useful set of tools for us to look at: mind mapping tools.  The map below was generated using [My Mind](http://www.sebastian-krauss.de/software/#mymind) which is s great mind mapping tool on OS Xs.  There is also the very popular [FreeMind](http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) available on many different platforms (Windows, OS X, etc.)
