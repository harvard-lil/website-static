With the emergence of large scale multi-touch screens we may be able to create a life-size digital bookshelf.  See the following pointers:

* [Perceptive Pixel (Jeff Han's company)](http://www.perceptivepixel.com)
* [The Jeff Han TED presentation](http://www.ted.com/talks/jeff_han_demos_his_breakthrough_touchscreen.html)
* [Microsoft's Surface site](http://www.microsoft.com/surface/)

Imagine a 4ft x 6ft screen which renders a bookshelf, but a bookshelf augmented with faceted search, re-organization, etc. essentially allowing the books on the shelf to re-organize themselves and the ability to "grab" the books for later viewing on-line or desk pick-up.  Another benefit is that the shelf could be made to work with a very large catalog of publications and not be limited by its physical size.
