This is a really good talk.  People give these advice talks about creativity/innovation etc. all the time, but this one by Jack Dorsey (twitter inventor) is absolutely worth the time. really got me thinking. He's a real inventor.  His newest idea is pretty awesome as well.

<div class="embed-container"><iframe title="Jack Dorsey" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/11712774" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

It also reminded me of the [Library Hose](https://lil.law.harvard.edu/twitter/).  Not because of Twitter (which is the broadcast channel for this), but because it was an idea that we did a while back and kinda shelved.  And now its coming back around into ShelfLife.
