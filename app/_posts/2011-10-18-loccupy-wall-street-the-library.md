There's a [blog](http://peopleslibrary.wordpress.com/) about the library of works being accumulated by the Occupy Wall Street folks. The list of titles is a [LibraryThing](http://www.librarything.com/catalog.php?view=OWSLibrary&sort=stampREV).

Wouldn't that be an interesting collection of metadata to pull into LibraryCloud?
