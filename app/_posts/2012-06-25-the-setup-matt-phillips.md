We're regular readers of [The Setup](http://usesthis.com/). We really like it. We like it so much that we're doing a local version for the Lab. Matt is up first.

**Who are you, and what do you do?**

I'm Matt Phillips.

I work in the Harvard Library Innovation Lab. I try to make libraries better, usually by writing software.

**What hardware do you use?**

While at the Lab, most of my work happens on an [i3, 21.5" iMac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_iMac). I have a second [24" Acer monitor](http://us.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/group/monitors) sitting next to it. I use an [Apple Magic Mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Mouse) and a [109 key Apple keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Keyboard#Apple_Pro_Keyboard_.28M7803.29). Pretty vanilla.

When I'm not in the office I use an [i5, 15" Mac Book Pro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macbook_pro). I love this machine.

We have a few [Dell PowerEdge machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_PowerEdge) sitting in a closet upstairs we use for testing, data crunching, and to serve up our public site. We also have a couple of [Amazon EC2 instances](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) we use for [Library News](http://news.librarycloud.org/) and a skunkworks project.

That's the bigger hardware.

My head spends about a third of its day wrapped in [Sennheiser HD 515 headphones](http://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-HD515-Dynamic-Audiophile-Headphones/dp/B0001FTVDG).

I occasionally break out of the digital world and scratch things out on paper. This usually happens when I'm trying to architect a piece of system or I'm working through some tough logic. I've found that I really like strips of paper for drawing out ideas. 8.5" x 11" pieces cut lengthwise are perfect.

[Rollerball pens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollerball_pen) are my go to.

Paper also enters my workspace when I'm proofing a draft of a blog entry or something that I think might reach more than a handful friendly people. Paper and pen are so easy to use. They require very little cognitive overhead. They let you focus on the content and not the tools.

I have a [first generation iPad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad) and a [third generation Kindle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle), but I rarely use them. If I want to do computer stuff, I use my laptop. If I want to read a book, I'm generally on paper. I'm not a paper fetishist, it's just that my library generally lends me non-digital items.

My [iPhone 4s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_4S) gets regular use during the day. I use it for music and for quick pictures and videos.

**And what software?**

Most of my day is spent in [OS X](http://www.apple.com/osx/). When I'm working on one of our servers, I'm in [CentOS](http://www.centos.org/), some [Redhat](http://www.redhat.com/) somethignororther, or [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/).

I rely heavily on [Quicksilver](https://github.com/quicksilver/quicksilver) for application launching.

I have a whole bunch of different user accounts and API keys. I use [Keychain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keychain_(Mac_OS)) to keep track of them.

I manage myself using lists. Lately, I've been hot on [Trello](https://trello.com/).

[Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) is the browser I prefer. I've bolstered Chrome with the [JSONView plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc), the [Google Screen Capture plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cpngackimfmofbokmjmljamhdncknpmg), the [Readable bookmarklet](http://readable.tastefulwords.com/), the [AdBlock plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom), and the [Instapaper bookmarklet](http://www.instapaper.com/).

I spend most of my development time in [PyDev](http://pydev.org/) (which is a [Python](http://www.python.org/) centric bundling of [Eclipse](http://eclipse.org/)).

If I'm coding and I'm not in PyDev, I'm probably doing some quick proof of concept scripting or doing some [PHP](http://www.php.net/)/[JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)/Web development . For this type of work I'll use [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) if I'm working locally and [vi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi) if I'm working remotely.

We track code using [git](http://git-scm.com/) and push almost all work to [GitHub](https://github.com/harvard-lil). We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/blog/831-issues-2-0-the-next-generation) for project management. We really dig GitHub in the lab.

GitHub encourages [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for READMEs and the like. When I write Markdown, I use [Jon Combe's online editor](http://joncom.be/experiments/markdown-editor/edit/).

[Spotify](http://www.spotify.com/) for tunes.

I use [Skype](http://skype.com) and [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) to communicate with those outside the office. IRC happens through [Colloquy](http://colloquy.info/).

I like to check the weather to see if I'll be able to spin the bicycle around for a few miles after work. I'm into [WeatherSpark](http://weatherspark.com) for forecasts.

**What would be your dream setup?**

I could go wild with the dream setup, but I feel like bounding it a bit. Here's what I think might be feasible in a couple years with a generous office budget.

I want a really great laptop. A [third generation, i7, Retina display, 15 inch MacBook Pro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Pro). I'd pair it with a [27" Apple Thunderbolt Display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Thunderbolt_Display). I'd pile all of that on a standing/sitting desk.

I'd also create an ideal office space. No office mates. A glass wall that insulates sound very well. I want to be able to see what's going on in the common work areas and I want people to see that they can get me if needed, but I don't want the noise when I'm focusing. I'm sold on the [Joel Spolsky office setup](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/12/29.html).

Quick access to great coffee and water would be nice too.
