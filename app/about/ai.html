          Generative AI offers a defining moment where information
        archives gain the ability to answer questions about
        themselves; to act without human intervention; and even to
        simulate the processes that created them.  From our
        perspective at the lab - where we bring library principles to
        technological frontiers - anyone who is concerned with
        information, access, and the law should be aware of and feel
        empowered to influence the use of generative AIs. We have
        embarked upon a series of projects in support of that belief.

        <h3 id="cold-data-set">Collaborative Open Legal Data (COLD) Data Set</h3>
        <p>
          We are proud to announce COLD Cases, a research data set for
          the open law community.
        </p>
        <p>
          The legal nonprofit <a href="https://free.law/">Free Law
          Project</a> maintains a wide variety of web crawlers to
          collect and publish an ever-growing data set of public domain
          law at
          <a href="http://courtlistener.com/">CourtListener.com</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          We have collaborated with FLP to release COLD Cases as a
          data set suitable for machine
          learning <a href="https://huggingface.co/data sets/harvard-lil/cold-cases">available
          on HuggingFace</a> along with
          a <a href="https://datanutrition.org/labels/v3/?id=c29976b2-858c-4f4e-b7d0-c8ef12ce7dbe">Data
          Nutrition Label</a> which explains the source of the data
          and gives guidelines for ethical use. The result is
          information about over 8 million court cases available for
          batch processing in the context of data science, AI
          experiments, and legal tool building.
        </p>

        <h3 id="one-million-books">One Million Books</h3>
        <p>
          Building on our work on the COLD Data Set, we are working
          with the Harvard Libraries to identify more public domain
          data sets that can support computational research and AI
          experimentation for the public good. One project underway
          would release a large cache of digitized books and accurate
          metadata, in collaboration with library technologists and
          researchers exploring consent and bias issues.
        </p>

        <h3 id="cap-and-the-right-to-access">Caselaw Access Project and the Right to Access Edicts of Law</h3>
        <p>
          In 2017, the Harvard Law Library kicked off the Caselaw
          Access Project (CAP), by digitizing 360 years of U.S. case
          law. The Library Innovation Lab transformed it into the
          largest U.S. legal database of its time. Much of this data
          is public and discoverable for free on LIL’s
          site <a href="https://case.law">case.law.</a>
        </p>

        <p>
          At the end of February 2024, this collection will become
        fully open as a data set structured for reading by humans and
        machines. We are collaborating with friends at LexisNexis,
        Fastcase, and the Free Law Project to ensure the maximum
        social benefit of this launch. We expect part of the launch
        will include a public declaration and call for a human right
        to access the edicts of law.
        </p>

        <h3 id="open-french-law-chatbot">Open French Law Chatbot</h3>
        <p>
          This experiment explores whether an open-source LLM (Llama
        2) can act as both translator and French law expert if
        provided with the French legal code as a vector database. The
        case study will delve into the potential and limitations of
        open-source LLMs and associated toolchains, and to what extent
        embedding models and vector databases can augment and “ground”
        the responses provided by LLMs. In addition, LIL will publish
        the embeddings database containing the entirety of French law.
        </p>

        <h3 id="model-academic-research-agreement">Model Academic Research Agreement</h3>
        <p>
          We have drafted and are seeking initial partners for a Model
        Academic Research Agreement, which would make it easier,
        faster, and safer for academic researchers to provide advice
        on unreleased products and models, benefiting both academia
        and industry.
        </p>

        <h3 id="library-data-trust">Library Data Trust</h3>
        <p>
          Research into speculative funding structures for libraries
          and their collections. The Library Data Trust would set up a
          structure whereby libraries and archives digitize their
          collections and make them available for a fee to commercial
          users and for free to everyone else. The goal would be to
          make more collections available to more people while
          securing the financial future of libraries.
        </p>

        <h3 id="llms-and-book-ban-benchmark">LLMs and Book Ban Benchmark</h3>
        <p>
          Are LLMs champions of the freedom to read? The impetus of
this experiment was the news that
an <a href="https://www.popsci.com/technology/iowa-chatgpt-book-ban/"
> Iowa school district relied on ChatGPT’s responses to determine
which books to remove from the library.</a> We asked five different
LLMs to provide a justification for removing Toni Morrison’s <em>The
Bluest Eye</em> from library shelves with the objective of
demonstrating how “guardrails” differ among models and assessing the
impact of altering the temperature parameter. About 75% of the
responses across all five LLMs justified removing the book from
library
shelves. The <a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu/blog/2023/09/25/ai-book-bans-freedom-to-read-case-study/">case
study</a> was published prior to Banned Books Week in October 2023.

        <h3 id="creative-writing-llms">Creative Writing LLMs</h3>
        <p>
          This year, post-doc Katy Gero is working at the Library
        Innovation Lab and the Variation Lab at Harvard SEAS to
        investigate the implications of large language models in the
        creative writing field. Over the course of her time with us
        Katy will be undertaking research into what - if any -
        circumstances would lead literary writers to want their own
        work included as training data in a large language model. How
        would they want to be credited and/or compensated? Would they
        require restrictions on uses of the model? Are such
        restrictions feasible? What notion of consent is appropriate
        in this context?
        </p>

        <p>
          She will be conducting interviews within literary
        communities and their adjacent fields, with a secondary goal
        of producing a data set and releasing it based on the findings
        from contributing authors. If time allows, the data set could
        be used to train a Transformer model and begin investigations
        into its utility compared to other available models.
        </p>

        <h3 id="lil-vector">LIL Vector</h3>
        <p>
          lil_vector is our community server for experimenting with
        generative AI technology. Located in LIL space, this machine
        learning server allows us to freely explore the potential of
        open-source AI models. But more than a shared computing
        resource, it is a nascent community hub on which technologists
        from LIL and beyond share resources and experiments, as we
        collectively make sense of this AI moment.
        </p>

        <h3 id="harvard-lil-ai-fund">Harvard Library Innovation Lab AI Fund </h3>
        <p>
          To support this and other work, we have launched a LIL AI
        Fund to accept gifts and coordinate collaboration with law
        firms, legal technologists, foundations, and others working at
        the cutting edge of law, AI, libraries, and
        society. LexisNexis is the first supporter of the Fund;
        contact us to discuss participation.
