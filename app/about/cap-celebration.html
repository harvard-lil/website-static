  The Library Innovation Lab is hosting Transform: Justice at the Harvard Law
  School on March 9, 2024. A celebration of the full, unqualified release of the
  data from the <a href="https://case.law">Caselaw Access Project</a> will be the anchor of an event focused on
  the future of the access to law movement. Speakers across government, academia, and industry will sketch out the opportunities ahead of us for expanding access to legal data and its waterfall effects across society and justice. 
</p>
<p>
  Transform: Justice is a call to action during an inflection point for the world of open legal data. AI is shaking up the way we all think about the power of information and data. Free, accessible, and comprehensive access to the law is foundational to our democracy, and we believe we’re in a moment when big progress can be made. 
</p>
<p>Join us for the afternoon of March 9, 2024. Detailed schedule to come.</p>
