          is a call to action during an inflection point for the world of open legal data. AI is shaking up the way we all think about the power of information and data. Free, accessible, and comprehensive access to the law is foundational to our democracy, and we believe we’re in a moment when big progress can be made.

        <p>Generative AI offers a defining moment where information archives gain the ability to answer questions about themselves; to act without human intervention; and even to simulate the processes that created them. From our perspective at the lab - where we bring library principles to technological frontiers - anyone who is concerned with information, access, and the law should be aware of and feel empowered to influence the use of generative AIs. We have embarked upon a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/about/ai">series of projects</a> in support of that belief.</p>
