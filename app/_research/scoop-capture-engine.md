Because we wondered: What would a browser-based capture engine look like if its main goal was to create evidence for an article, court case, or fact check?

Scoop is a high fidelity, browser-based, web archiving capture engine from the [Harvard Library Innovation Lab](https://lil.law.harvard.edu/).

Fine-tune this custom web capture software to create robust single-page captures of the internet with accurate and complete provenance information.

With extensive options for asset formats and inclusions, Scoop will create .warc, warc.gz or .wacz files to be stored by users and replayed using the web archive replay software of their choosing.

Scoop also comes with built-in support for the [WACZ Signing and Verification specification](https://specs.webrecorder.net/wacz-auth/0.1.0/), allowing users to cryptographically sign their captures.
