				<p>
					The Library Innovation Lab is a team of librarians,
					programmers, artists, and lawyers with a broad mission: to
					build open source tools and services, open to everyone and
					in the public interest, solving serious emerging problems
					from the unique perspective of the world's largest academic
					law library. On the tech side we work most often with Django,
					Vue, and Postgres.

				<p>
					<b>Deadline extended:</b> we will be accepting applications for this role on a rolling basis through May 1, 2022. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					
					We're seeking incoming first-year law students with a background in technology or design to join the Library
					Innovation Lab as summer research assistants. <b>Join us this summer to get a head start on adapting to law
					school and hack on sites that expand access to the law.</b>
				</p>

				<p>
					We work at the intersection of libraries, technology, and the law, building and supporting projects that
					broaden access to information through open source software. This summer, we're seeking research assistants to
					participate broadly in the life and work of LIL, and to help our team advance our development goals in the
					fields of open access data and learning.
				</p>

				<p>
					As a research assistant, you will have the opportunity to jump into legal academia via a technical
					standpoint, rooting yourself in a law library focused both on innovation and legal tradition. You will help us
					imagine and act on new ways to serve the growing community of faculty, librarians and students who are
					interested in our three tent-pole projects: <a href="https://opencasebook.org">H2O Open Casebook</a>, <a
						href="https://case.law">The Caselaw Access Project</a> and <a href="https://perma.cc">Perma.cc</a>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Our team will work with each research assistant to scope out a development roadmap that builds upon our
					current project goals and highlights the candidate's interests. We're looking for a collaborator, not an
					intern.
				</p>

				<p>
					The ideal research assistant will be an incoming law student with a technical background who is curious,
					self-motivated and eager to interact directly with our team and the broader law school community. While
					neither legal nor specific technical expertise is required, we are seeking candidates who would feel
					comfortable developing alongside a team who works mainly with Django and Vue.

					students from any law school, we are happy to consider applicants from other backgrounds as well, with cover
					letter explaining interest.
				</p>

				<h3>Compensation</h3>
