                The Library Innovation Lab is a team of librarians, programmers, artists, and lawyers with a broad mission: to
                build open-source tools and services to advance open knowledge.</p>
              <p>We currently support three long-running services

              <p>On the tech side, we work most often with Django, Vue, and Postgres.

                LIL offers a rare mix of contemplation and action: we are a small software lab within one of the world’s
                largest law libraries, with a mission both to try new things and to think deeply about what ought to exist
                for the long haul. Our mission offers a range of benefits for staff:
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Job stability and support.</strong> While we maintain the creative atmosphere and flexibility of a small innovation lab, we're backed by an established institution with strong benefits and support for employees.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>Room to pursue your research agenda.</strong> We are located at the Harvard Law School Library and share a kitchen with  the Berkman Klein Center and metaLAB. Going to events, having conversations, developing your scholarly perspective, and exploring it through creative projects are encouraged. We will specifically prioritize these things at the cost of shipping the next feature.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>Set your own pace.</strong> We are a small, self-directed group that depends on internal motivation rather than externally imposed crunch time.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>Build open source.</strong> All of our projects are open source and otherwise designed to maximize the public benefit of our work.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>Work on stuff that matters.</strong> The projects we make are measured by how they help people in the long term.</p>

                We are based in a newly-renovated space on the Harvard Law School campus. Our full-time staff positions are
                hybrid/in-person; we typically aim to be in the office Tuesday through Thursday. Contractor and fellowship
                positions may be remote by individual arrangement.

                The work and well-being of the Lab are strengthened profoundly by the
                diversity of our community and our differences in background, culture,
                experience, racial identity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, and much
                more. We actively seek and welcome applications from Black and Indigenous people and people of color;
                women and non-binary people; the LGBTQ+ community; and people with disabilities; as well as
                applications from researchers and practitioners from across the
                spectrum of disciplines, methods, and life experiences.
