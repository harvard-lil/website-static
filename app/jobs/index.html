                The Library Innovation Lab is a team of librarians, programmers, artists, and lawyers with a broad mission: to
                build open-source tools and services to advance open knowledge.</p>
              <p>We currently support three long-running services (

              <p>On the tech side, we work most often with Django, Vue, and Postgres.

                LIL offers a rare mix of contemplation and action: we are a small software lab within one of the world’s
                largest law libraries, with a mission both to try new things and to think deeply about what ought to exist
                for the long haul. Our mission offers a range of benefits for staff:
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Job stability and support.</strong> While we maintain the creative atmosphere and flexibility of a small innovation lab, we're backed by an established institution with strong benefits and support for employees.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>Room to pursue your research agenda.</strong> We are located at the Harvard Law School Library and share a kitchen with  the Berkman Klein Center and metaLAB. Going to events, having conversations, developing your scholarly perspective, and exploring it through creative projects are encouraged. We will specifically prioritize these things at the cost of shipping the next feature.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>Set your own pace.</strong> We are a small, self-directed group that depends on internal motivation rather than externally imposed crunch time.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>Build open source.</strong> All of our projects are open source and otherwise designed to maximize the public benefit of our work.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>Work on stuff that matters.</strong> The projects we make are measured by how they help people in the long term.</p>

                The work and well-being of the Lab are strengthened profoundly by the

                experience, racial identity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, and much
                more. We actively seek and welcome applications from Black and Indigenous people and people of color;
                women and non-binary people; the LGBTQ+ community; and people with disabilities; as well as
                applications from researchers and practitioners from across the

                The Library Innovation Lab offers a small number of
                stipended fellowships to people developing tools and
                communities to explore the future of open knowledge.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Who should apply:</strong> Fellowships are a particularly good fit for people&mdash;
                inside and outside academia!&mdash;with a track record of
                building tools or leading communities that advance the
                conversation about cultural knowledge and the internet,
                and who need financial and institutional support to take
                their next steps.
              </p>
              <p>
                By "cultural knowledge and the internet," we mean
                questions like: how do established cultural memory
                institutions adapt to the internet age and help societies
                reconstruct and remember their history? How do societies
                govern themselves, coordinate solutions to problems, and
                decide who to trust in the evolving information landscape?
                How do we preserve today's knowledge for future
                generations?
              </p>
              <p>
                In short, who are we, how did we get here, and where are
                we going? And who is "we" in a networked world anyway?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Fellowship details:</strong> Fellowships are individually arranged on a rolling basis,
                and may be any length from a week to a year. Fellows are
                expected to visit Harvard in person for a portion of the
                appointment, but need not be present full time. Stipends
                are available to support full-time work, but may be
                prorated depending on time commitment and other sources of
                support.
