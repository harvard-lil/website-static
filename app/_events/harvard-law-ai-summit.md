The Harvard Law AI Summit was an invitation-only gathering across the spectrum of law, government, AI research, civil society and social science. The summit explored how AI as a new form of knowledge is poised to challenge and reshape institutions.

Generative AI offers a defining moment where information archives gain the ability to answer questions about themselves; to act without human intervention; and even to infer and replicate the processes that created them. It will challenge and reshape every institution — for better and worse — and we cannot draw on just one field or expertise to respond to it.

The one-day summit observed the Chatham House Rule and featured short, provocative talks from leaders in fields working on, or affected by, AI. This was combined with discussion among participants selected for their incisive, expert perspectives on what comes next.
