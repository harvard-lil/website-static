"WAMMI" replaces "WASAPI" as our favorite acronym.</p> </li> <li> <p>How do we integrate user research into day-to-day development? We'll be chewing more on that one.</p> </li> <li> <p><a href="http://www.jeffersonbailey.com/">Jefferson Bailey</a> shares the Internet Archive's learnings ups and downs with <a href="https://webarchive.jira.com/wiki/display/ARS/Archive-It+Research+Services">Archive-It Research Services</a>. Projects from the last year include <a href="http://www.comparativeagendas.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Gade-and-Wilkerson.pdf">.GOV</a> (100TB of .gov data in a Hadoop cluster donated by <a href="https://www.altiscale.com/">Altiscale</a>), the L3S <a href="http://alexandria-project.eu/">Alexandria Project</a>, and something we didn't catch with Ian Milligan at <a href="http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/Pages/home.aspx">Archives.ca</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>You too can learn archive research with Vinay Goel's <a href="https://github.com/vinaygoel/ars-workshop">Archive Research Services Workshop</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>PLUS Jefferson threw in some amazing stuff we still haven't quite figured out involving <a href="https://github.com/vinaygoel/ars-workshop/blob/master/notebooks/WAT-Analysis.ipynb">iPython Notebooks with connections to big data sets</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>What the WAT? We hear a lot about WATs this year. Common Crawl has a good <a href="http://commoncrawl.org/2014/04/navigating-the-warc-file-format/">explainer</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p><a href="http://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/ditte-laursen(3ae302d0-3c64-4e72-9227-a7612dd746a8).html">Ditte Laursen</a> sets out to answer a big research question: "What does Danish web look like?" What is the shape of .dk? Eld Zierau reports that in a comparison of the Royal Danish Library's .dk collection with the Internet Archive's collection of Danish-language sites, only something like 10% were in both.</p> </li> <li> <p><a href="http://www.timelessfuture.com/about/">Hugo Huurdeman</a> asks an important question: what exactly _is _a website? Is it a host, a domain, or a set of pages that share the same CSS? To visualize change in whatever that is, he uses <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ssdeep">ssdeep</a>, a fuzzy hashing mechanism for page comparison.</p> </li> <li> <p>Let's just pause to say how inspiring this all is. It's at about this point in the day that we started totally rethinking a project we've been working on for months.</p> </li> <li> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/justin_littman?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Justin Littman</a> shares the <a href="http://library.gwu.edu/scholarly-technology-group/social-feed-manager">Social Feed Manager</a>, his happenin' stack to harvest tweets and such.</p> </li> <li> <p>We learned that TWARC is either twerking for WARCs or <a href="http://library.gwu.edu/scholarly-technology-group/social-feed-manager">a Twitter-harvesting Python package</a> – we're not entirely sure. Either way it's our new new favorite acronym. Sorry, WAMMI.</p> </li> <li> <p>Nick Ruest and Ian Milligan give a very cool talk about sifting through hashtagged content on Twitter. Did you know that researchers only have 7-9 days to grab tweets under a hashtag before Twitter only makes the full stream available for a fee? (We did not know that.)</p> </li> <li> <p>We were also impressed by Canada's huge amount of political social media engagement. Even though Canada isn't a huge country,[Ian's words not ours] 55,000 Tweets were generated in one day with the #elxn42 tag.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fernando Melo of Arquivo.pt pointed out that the struggle is <em>real</em> with live-web leaks in <a href="https://github.com/Fernando-Melo/WaybackComparison">his research comparing OpenWayback and pywb</a>. Fernando says in his tests OpenWayback was faster but <a href="https://github.com/ikreymer/pywb">pywb</a> has higher-quality playbacks (more successes, fewer leaks). Both tools are expected to improve soon. We say it's time for something like <a href="https://arewefastyet.com/">arewefastyet.com</a> to make this a proper competition.</p> </li> <li> <p>Nicola Bingham is self-deprecating about the British Library's extensive QA efforts: "This talk title isn't quite right because it implies that we have Quality Assurance Practices in the Post Legal Deposit Environment." They use the <a href="http://webcurator.sourceforge.net/">Web Curator Tool QA Module</a>, but are having to go beyond that for domain-scale archiving.</p> </li> <li> <p>We're also curious about this paper: <a href="http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc333026/m2/1/high_res_d/QA_in_WebArchiving.pdf">Current Quality Assurance Practices in Web Archiving</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/toddstoffer">Todd Stoffer</a> demos NC State's <a href="http://go.ncsu.edu/qa-demo">QA tool</a>. A clever blend of tools like Google Forms, Trello, and IFTTT to let student employees provide archive feedback during downtime. Here are Todd's [snazzy HTML/JS] <a href="http://toddstoffer.github.io/presentation/IIPC-2016/#/">slides</a>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>TL;DR: lots of exciting things happening in the archiving world. Also exciting: the Icelandic political landscape.

We'll have lots of details from IIPC coming soon, but for this first post we wanted to share some of the things we're noticing here in Reykjavik.</em></p> <p><strong>[Genève]</strong> Nothing in Reykjavik seems to be empty space. There is always room for something different, new, creative, or odd to fill voids. This is the parking garage of the Harpa concert hall. Traditional fluorescent lamps are interspersed with similar ones in bright colors.</p> <p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/04/image07.jpg" alt="image07"></p> <p><strong>[Jack]</strong> I love how many ways there are to design something as simple as a bathroom. Here are some details I noticed in our guest house:</p> <p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/04/iceland-wc.jpg" alt="iceland-wc"></p> <p><em>Clockwise from top left: shower set into floor; sweet TP stash as design element; soap on a spike and exposed hot/cold pipes; toilet tank built into wall.</em></p> <p><strong>[Matt]</strong> Walking around the city is colorful and delightful. Spotting an engaging piece of street art is a regular occurrence. A wonderful, regular occurrence.</p> <p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/04/image05.jpg" alt="image05"></p> <p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/04/image03.jpg" alt="image03"></p> <p><strong>[Anastasia]</strong> After returning from Iceland for the first time a year ago, I found myself missing something I don't normally give much thought to: Icelandic money is some of the loveliest currency I have ever seen.</p> <p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/04/image01.jpg" alt="image01"></p> <p>The banknotes are quite complex artistically, and yet every denomination abides by thoughtful design principles. Each banknote's side shows either a culturally-significant figure or scene. The denomination is displayed prominently, the typography is ornate but consistent. The colors, beautiful.</p> <p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/04/20160412_083711.jpg" alt="20160412_083711"></p> <p>But what trumps the aesthetics is the banknotes' dimensions. Icelandic paper money is sized according to amount: the 500Kr note is smaller than the 1000Kr note, which in turn is outsized by the 5000Kr note. This is incredibly important — it allows visually impaired people to move about more freely in the world.</p> <p>In comparison, our money looks silly and our treasury department negligent, as it is impossible to differentiate the values by touch alone. And, confoundingly, there don't seem to be movements to amend this either: in 2015 the department made "strides" by announcing it would start providing money readers, little machines that read value to people who filled out what I'm sure is not a fun amount of paperwork, instead of coming up with a simple design solution.</p> <p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/04/20160412_0838192.jpg" alt="20160412_083819"></p> <p>The coins are a different story. When I first arrived the clunky coins were a happy surprise — they're delightfully weighty (maybe even a little too bulky for normally non-cash-carrying types), adorned with beautifully thoughtful designs. On one side of each of the coins (gold or silver), the denomination stands out in large type along with local sea creatures: a big Lumpfish, three small Capelin fish, a dolphin, a Shore crab.</p> <p>On the reverse side the four great guardians of Iceland gaze intensely. They are the dragon (<em>Dreki</em>), the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffin&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1460504622399000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEy35QitPr43C8DEijljLn4Uby7Dg">griffin</a> (<em>Gammur</em>), the bull (<em>Griðungur</em>), and the giant (<em>Bergrisi</em>), that each protected Iceland from Denmark invasion in turn, according to the Saga of King Olaf Tryggvason. On the back of the 1 Krona, only the giant stands, commanding.</p> <p>And that's it. No superfluous information. No humans, either, only mythology and fish.</p> <p>Returning home is good things, but sometimes it also means re-entering a world where money is just sad green rectangles (and oddly sized coins) full of earthly men.</p> </div> <footer> </footer> </article> </div> <div class="sleeve"> <article itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"> <header> <time class="post-date" datetime="2016-04-04T18:29:06+00:00">April 4, 2016</time> <h2 class="post-title" itemprop="headline"> <a href="/blog/2016/04/04/how-were-freeing-the-law-part-1-books/">How We're Freeing the Law, Part 1: Books</a></h2> <p class="post-author">Posted by Adi Kamdar</p> </header> <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <div class="author-intro"> <img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/04/1c60deb.jpg" alt=""> <p><span class="name">Adi Kamdar</span> is a 1L at Harvard Law School and our embedded reporter on the Free the Law project. In this first post, he tracks the progress of a casebook through our scanning process from start to finish.</p> </div> <p>Harvard Law Library is one of the few collections with nearly every law reporter—roughly 40,000 books in total. The Free the Law project's goal is to put the court decisions inside these volumes online, so anyone can access the precedents that shape the American legal system. Right now, the project is about halfway through, and within the next couple years they'll have completed this monumental task.</p> <p>But how exactly does a book become a byte? And what happens to these physical texts after they've been digitized?</p> <h2 id="harvard-depository">Harvard Depository</h2> <p>The project begins each week with a book order—a 600 book order, to be exact, for law reporters that chronicle U.S. legal history since the country's inception.</p> <p>The law reporters are held in a sprawling warehouse 30 miles away from the law school—the <a href="http://hul.harvard.edu/hd/pages/facility.html">Harvard Depository</a>. With over 200,000 square feet of storage space, the climate-controlled Depository's mission is <a href="https://vimeo.com/116603551">pure efficiency</a>: each book—and there are over nine million—is sorted and stored by size, rather than by name or author, in order to maximize space.</p> <p>But it turns out law reporters are the packing peanuts of the Harvard Depository. When the reporters were first sent over to the warehouse, instead of being stored normally, they kept the volumes around in the packaging room. Whenever they filled a cardboard box with other books for storage, they would throw in a reporter or two if there was any extra space that needed to be filled. No one thought the print reporters would be that useful anymore, so making them easily available in bulk was a low priority. Plus, the library had decided to cancel print runs of reporters in 2010, saving valuable shelf space, especially when digital copies were easily available online.</p> <p>Because of this tactic, law reporters are spread all throughout the Depository. Asking for, say, Michigan's volumes isn't as simple as pulling out a handful of boxes—it's a hunt.</p> <h2 id="langdell-library">Langdell Library</h2> <p>Every Wednesday, the team receives the 600 volumes of case reporters. They line the hallway of the ground floor of Langdell, filling shelf after shelf. One by one, each book is examined before it can be taken apart. (Some books—for example, volumes with marginalia—are flagged for archival purposes.) Each volume is then catalogued and given a unique barcode so it can be tracked throughout the whole process.</p> <p><a href="http://imgur.com/o7hwfTX"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/o7hwfTX.jpg" alt=""></a></p> <p>The books are then taken to the Prep Room where, ironically, they're repaired before they're chopped up. Damaged pages are taped together, book bindings are cut off by hand, and the remaining sheets are taken over to a guillotine. Once aligned, the operator has to press two separate buttons underneath the cutting table at the same time to make sure her hands aren't under the blade. The result? Cleanly cut pages.</p> <p><a href="http://imgur.com/ipa45yK"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ipa45yK.jpg" alt="View post on imgur.com"></a></p> <p><a href="http://imgur.com/9WCsJhP"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/9WCsJhP.jpg" alt="View post on imgur.com"></a></p> <p>Next, the bundle of pages is hauled over to the Scanning Room. Here, six employees work overlapping shifts to ensure that pages are being scanned every day, 14 hours a day. Roughly 200 documents per minute are fed through the machine, which has a camera on top and bottom to image both sides of the page.</p> <p><a href="http://imgur.com/OPEdH9y"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/OPEdH9y.jpg" alt="View post on imgur.com"></a></p> <p><a href="http://imgur.com/2TgT2sr"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/2TgT2sr.jpg" alt="View post on imgur.com"></a></p> <p><a href="http://imgur.com/COKw2x2"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/COKw2x2.jpg" alt="View post on imgur.com"></a></p> <p>Now that the books are chopped and scanned, what happens to the physical pages? After all, the purpose of this project is to digitize the law. Plus, according to circulation records, very few people were reading the old reporters anyway. Rebinding them and keeping them in the library would be a waste of space, time, and money. But just in case anyone questions the authenticity of the scans, Harvard decided it would be valuable to have the physical copies accessible. So the project decided to vacuum seal the pages. Once the pages are jogged together (using a state-of-the-art paper-jogging machine) and placed back inside their book jacket, the volumes are taken over to one last room—where they will be put inside a meat packing device. Yes, it turns out that the meat industry unwittingly stumbled across the best way to preserve books. The machine shrink wraps the pages, maintaining the integrity of the volume while handily adding an extra layer of protection from mold, humidity, and bugs.</p> <p><a href="http://imgur.com/jAXte1p"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/jAXte1p.jpg" alt="View post on imgur.com"></a></p> <p>The re-bound volumes are then re-shelved, where they await being shipped off to…</p> <p><a href="http://imgur.com/NGAgmeU"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/NGAgmeU.jpg" alt="View post on imgur.com"></a></p> <h2 id="louisville-kentucky">Louisville, Kentucky</h2> <p>Because of the Harvard Law Library's limited shelf capacity, the newly packaged pages will soon be loaded onto trucks and shipped down to Louisville.</p> <p>Why Kentucky? Well, because of <a href="http://www.undergroundvaults.com/about-us/louisville/">Underground Vaults &amp; Storage</a>, a company that has been storing all manner of things in Louisville's old limestone mines. The sealed books will be stored there (where they will "fear no tornado, wildfire, flood or other natural disaster") until the rare instance that they need to be recalled.</p> <p>And that's the story of these legal volumes—from one massive depository to another, by way of a guillotine, a scanner, and a meat packer. In our next post, we'll explore what happens after they become digital images, and how Free the Law is building the largest free database of legal opinions in the world.</p> </div> <footer> <span class="category"><a href="/blog/category/free-the-law">Free the Law</a></span> </footer> </article> </div> <div class="pagination sleeve"> <span class="page_number">Page: 4 of 32</span> <div> <a href="/blog/page/3/" class="small-btn" role="button">Previous</a> <a href="/blog/page/5/" class="small-btn" role="button">Next</a> </div> </div> </section> <footer> <div class="sleeve"> <figure class="footer-logo"> <img src="/assets/thumbs/351x143r/lab-logo-footer-home.png" srcset="/assets/thumbs/351x143r/lab-logo-footer-home.png, /assets/thumbs/702x286r/lab-logo-footer-home.png 2x" alt="Library Innovation Lab" class="img-full-width"> </figure> <ul> <li><a href="/">Home</a></li> <li><a href="/about/">About</a></li> <li><a href="/projects/">Projects</a></li> <li><a href="/sketches/">Sketches</a></li> <li><a href="/blog/">Blog</a></li> </ul> <div class="footer-copyright"> <p>&copy;2017 The President and Fellows of Harvard University</p> <p>The content on this site is covered under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license unless otherwise noted.</p> </div> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
