But think about what this particular DRM bomb does to libraries, one of the longest continuous institutions of civilization. Libraries exist not just to lend books but to guarantee their continuous availability throughout changes in culture and fashion. This new licensing scheme prevents libraries from accomplishing this essential mission.</p> <p>It's beyond ironic. Until now, libraries have in fact had to scale back on that mission because there isn't enough space for all the physical books they've acquired over the years. So, they get rid of books that have fallen out of fashion or no longer seem important enough. Now that the digital revolution has so lowered the cost of storage that libraries can at last do far better at this culture-building mission, a major publisher has instituted the nightmare culture-killing license.</p> <p>So, why do I say that HarperCollins has lost its soul instead of just criticizing it for this action? Because if you cared about books as vehicles of ideas and not just vehicles of commerce, you would have dismissed with contempt an idea that treats them as evanescent as chatter on a call-in show.</p> </div> <footer> <span class="tag"><a href="/blog/tag/copyright">copyright</a></span> <span class="tag"><a href="/blog/tag/drm">drm</a></span> <span class="tag"><a href="/blog/tag/ebooks">ebooks</a></span> <span class="category"><a href="/blog/category/books">books</a></span> <span class="category"><a href="/blog/category/copyright">copyright</a></span> <span class="category"><a href="/blog/category/library-ecology">library ecology</a></span> <span class="category"><a href="/blog/category/open-access">open access</a></span> </footer> </article> </div> <div class="sleeve"> <article itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"> <header> <time class="post-date" datetime="2011-02-23T18:24:39+00:00">February 23, 2011</time> <h2 class="post-title" itemprop="headline"> <a href="/blog/2011/02/23/stackview-the-stop-action-version/">StackView: The Stop-Action Version</a></h2> <p class="post-author">Posted by <a href="/about/#david-weinberger">David Weinberger</a></p> </header> <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <div class="embed-container"><iframe width="320" height="240" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cFnuP9niRUg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div> <p>(via Cory Doctorow at <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2011/02/23/books-marching-aroun.html">BoingBoing</a>)</p> </div> <footer> <span class="category"><a href="/blog/category/books">books</a></span> <span class="category"><a href="/blog/category/humor">Humor</a></span> <span class="category"><a href="/blog/category/stackview">StackView</a></span> </footer> </article> </div> <div class="sleeve"> <article itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"> <header> <time class="post-date" datetime="2011-02-14T19:41:45+00:00">February 14, 2011</time> <h2 class="post-title" itemprop="headline"> <a href="/blog/2011/02/14/why-do-you-or-dont-you-edit-wikipedia/">Why do you, or don't you, edit Wikipedia?</a></h2> <p class="post-author">Posted by <a href="/about/#david-weinberger">David Weinberger</a></p> </header> <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <p>Wikipedia is looking for volunteers to answer some questions as they try to understand why researchers and experts do and do not contribute to Wikipedia. From the email they've sent around:</p> <blockquote> <p>Wikipedia is increasingly used by university students for "pre-research", to gain context and explore ideas for course assignments and research projects [1]. Yet many among scientists, academics and other experts are reluctant to contribute to Wikipedia, despite a growing number of calls from the scientific community to join the project [2–3].</p> <p>The Wikimedia Research Committee [4] has just launched a survey to understand why scientists, academics and other experts do (or do not) contribute to Wikipedia and other collaborative projects, and whether individual motivation aligns with shared perceptions of Wikipedia within expert communities. We hope this may help us identify ways around barriers to expert participation. The survey is anonymous and takes about 20 min to complete.

These aspects include the international community of ISBN countries, the ratification by ISO of the standard and important standard definitions contained in the standard.
