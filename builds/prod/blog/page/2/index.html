(See also Matt’s <a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu/blog/2017/06/15/iipc-2017-day-one/.">post about the first day</a> Andrew Jackson of the British Library expanded on his talk the previous day about workflows for ingesting and processing web archives. Nick Ruest and Ian Milligan described <a href="http://webarchives.ca/">WALK</a>, or Web Archiving for Longitudinal Knowledge, a system for aggregating Canadian web archives, generating derivative products, and making them accessible via search and visualizations. Gregory Wiedeman from University at Albany, SUNY, described his process for automating the creation of web archive records in <a href="http://archivesspace.org/">ArchivesSpace</a> and adding descriptive metadata using <a href="https://archive-it.org/">Archive-It</a> APIs according to <a href="http://www2.archivists.org/standards/DACS">DACS</a> (Describing Archives: A Content Standard).</p> <p>After the break, the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive’s</a> Jefferson Bailey roared through a presentation of IA’s new tools, including systems for analysis, search, capture (<a href="https://github.com/internetarchive/brozzler!">Brozzler</a>, and availability. Mat Kelly from Old Dominion University described three tools for enabling non-techical users to create, index, and view web archives: <a href="http://warcreate.com/">WARCreate</a>, <a href="http://matkelly.com/wail">WAIL</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/machawk1/mink">Mink</a>. Lozana Rossenova and Ilya Kreymer of Rhizome demonstrated the use of containerized browsers for playback of web content that is no longer usable in modern browsers (think Java applets), as well as some upcoming features in <a href="https://webrecorder.io/">Webrecorder</a> for patching content into incomplete captures.</p> <p>Following lunch, Fernando Melo and João Nobre from <a href="http://arquivo.pt/">Arquivo.pt </a> described their new APIs for search and temporal analysis of Portuguese web archives. Nicholas Taylor of Stanford University Libraries talked about the ongoing rearchitecture of <a href="https://www.lockss.org/">LOCKSS</a> (Lots of Copies Keep Stuff Safe), expanding its role from a focus on the archiving of electronic journals to a tool for preserving web archives and other digital objects more generally. (In the Q&amp;A, LOCKSS founder David Rosenthal mentioned the article “<a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1920261.1920299">Familiarity breeds contempt</a>: the honeymoon effect and the role of legacy code in zero-day vulnerabilities”.) Jefferson Bailey returned, along with Naomi Dushay, also from the Internet Archive, to talk about <a href="https://github.com/WASAPI-Community/data-transfer-apis">WASAPI</a> (the Web Archiving Systems API) for transfer of data between archives.</p> <p>After another break, LIL’s own Jack Cushman took the stage with Ilya Kreymer for a fantastic presentation of <a href="http://warc.games/">warc.games</a>, a tool for exploring security issues in web archives: serving a captured web page is very much akin to hosting attacker-supplied content, and warc.games provides a series of challenges for trying out different kinds of attacks against a simplified local web archive. Mat Kelly then returned with David Dias of <a href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol Labs</a> to discuss <a href="https://github.com/oduwsdl/ipwb">InterPlanetary Wayback</a>, which stores web archive files in <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a>, the InterPlanetary File System. Finally, Andrew Jackson wrapped up the session by leading a discussion of planning for an IIPC hackathon or other mechanism for gathering to code.</p> <p>Thanks, all, for another excellent day!</p> </div> <footer> </footer> </article> </div> <div class="sleeve"> <article itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"> <header> <time class="post-date" datetime="2017-06-15T16:00:43+00:00">June 15, 2017</time> <h2 class="post-title" itemprop="headline"> <a href="/blog/2017/06/15/iipc-2017-day-one/">IIPC 2017 – Day One</a></h2> <p class="post-author">Posted by <a href="/about/#matt-phillips">Matt Phillips</a></p> </header> <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/146775445@N03/34457548734" title="Untitled"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4210/34457548734_287c2703f8_k.jpg" width="1536" height="2048" alt="Untitled"></a> <small>It's exciting to be back at IIPC this year to chat Perma.cc and web archives!</small></p> <p>The conference kicked off at on Wednesday, June 14, at 9:00 with coffee, snacks, and familiar faces from all parts of the world.

Thank you so much for hosting us!</p> <p><strong>Leah Lievrouw</strong>, <a href="http://www.ucla.edu/">UCLA</a> Web history and the landscape of communication/media research</p> <p><a href="http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/llievrou/LeahLievrouw/Welcome.html">Leah</a> told us that computers are viewed today as a medium — as human communication devices. This view is common now, but hasn’t been true for too long. Computers as a medium was very fringe even in the early 80s.</p> <p>We walked through a history of communications to gain more understanding of computers as human communication devices and started with some history of information organization and sharing.</p> <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Otlet">Paul Otlet</a> pushed efforts forward to organize all of the world’s information in the late 19th century Belgium and France.</p> <p><em><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Books/World-Made-Safe-Differences-Intellectuals/0585378444">The Coldwar Intellectuals</a></em> by J Light describes how networked information moved from the government and the military to the public.</p> <p>And, how that network information became interesting when it was push and pull — send an email and receive a response, or send a message on a UNIX terminal to another user and chat. Computers are social machines, not just calculating machines. Leah took us through how the internet and early patterns of the web were formed by the time and the culture — in this case, the incredible activity of Stanford, Berkley. Mileu of the Bay Area — bits and boolean logic through psychedelics. Fred Turner’s <em><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Counterculture-Cyberculture-Stewart-Network-Utopianism/dp/0226817423">From Counterculture to Cyberculture</a></em> is a fantastic read on this scene.</p> <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Brand">Stewart Brand</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson">Ted Nelson</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WELL">WELL online community</a>, and so on.</p> <p>We’re still talking about way before the web here. The idea of networked information was there, but we didn’t have a protocol (http) or a language (html) being used (web browser) at large scale (the web). <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wired-Cities-Shaping-Communications-Library/dp/0816118515">Wired Cities</a></em> by Dutton, Blumer, Kraemer sounds like a fantastic read to understand how mass wiring/communication made the a massive internet/web a possibility!</p> <p><em><a href="http://memex.org/licklider.pdf">The Computer as Communication Device</a></em> described by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._C._R._Licklider">J.C.R. Licklider</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Taylor_(computer_scientist)">Bob Taylor</a> was a clear vision to the future — we’re still not at a place where computers understand us as humans, we’re still are fairly rigid with defined request and responses patterns.</p> <p>The web was designed to access, create docs, that’s it. Early search engines and browsers exchanged discrete documents — we thought about the web as discrete, linked documents.</p> <p>Then, user generated content came along — wikis, blogs, tagging, social network sites. Now it’s easy for lots of folks to create content and and the network is even more powerful as a communication tool for many people!</p> <p>The next big phase came with mobile — about mid 2000s. More and more and more people! Data subject (data cloud or data footprint) is an approach that has felt interesting recently at UCLA. Maybe it’s real-time “flows” rather than “stacks” of docs or content.</p> <p>Technology as cultural material and material culture.</p> <p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/146775445@N03/34925213010" title="Untitled"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4240/34925213010_7550b06f2f_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1536" alt="Untitled"></a> <small>University of London is a fantastic space!</small></p> <p><strong>Jefferson Bailey</strong>, Internet Archive Advancing access and interface for research use of web archives</p> <p>Internet Archive is a massive archive! 32 Petabytes (with duplications)</p> <p>And, they have <a href="https://web-beta.archive.org/">search APIs</a>!!</p> <p>Holy smokes!!! Broad access to <a href="https://archive.org/web/">wayback</a> without a URL!!!!!!!</p> <p>IA has been working on a format called WAT.

Maybe the web counter and the alert box mark the page in time and can be used to understand the page!</p> <p>Analysis of data capture cannot be purely technical, has to be socio-technical.</p> <p>Digital desolation is a term that describes abandoned sites on the web. Sites that haven’t been restyled. Sites age over time. (Their wrinkles are frames and table !!?? lol)</p> <p>Old sites might not bubble to the top in today’s search engines — they’re likely at the long tail of what is returned.

With the assistance of LIL staff and interns, he directed a tiny film of four lines in about four minutes, then used it as a counter-example. Any mistake can break the suspension of disbelief, and amateurs are likely to make many mistakes. Infelicities in shot selection, lighting, sound, wardrobe and makeup, set design, editing, color, and so on destroy the viewer’s immersion in the film.</p> <p>An example is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/180-degree_rule">180-degree rule</a>: in alternating shots over the shoulders of two actors facing each other, the cameras must remain on the same side of the imaginary line joining the two actors. Breaking this rule produces cuts where the spatial relationship of the two actors appears to change from shot to shot.</p> <p>After some discussion of the differences between our tiny film and <em>Star Wars</em>, Jack gauged his crew’s enthusiasm, and directed another attempt, taking only slightly longer to shoot than the first try. Here are some stills from the set.</p> <p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/IMG_4849.jpg" alt=""></p> <p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/IMG_20170609_143351.jpg" alt=""></p> <p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/IMG_20170609_142406.jpg" alt=""></p> <p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/IMG_20170609_142706.jpg" alt=""></p> <p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/IMG_20170609_143210.jpg" alt=""></p> </div> <footer> </footer> </article> </div> <div class="sleeve"> <article itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"> <header> <time class="post-date" datetime="2017-06-05T16:00:43+00:00">June 5, 2017</time> <h2 class="post-title" itemprop="headline"> <a href="/blog/2017/06/05/lil-talks-synthesizer/">LIL Talks: Synthesizer</a></h2> <p class="post-author">Posted by <a href="/about/#adam-ziegler">Adam Ziegler</a></p> </header> <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <p>This week Ben Steinberg took us on a strange and magical trip through the world of synthesizers.</p> <p>Ben wasn’t talking about those Casio keyboards we all had as kids:</p> <p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/synth0-768x576.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>No, he was talking about this kind of thing … a self-built modular synthesizer:</p> <p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/syth1-768x1024.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Before showing off the hardware, Ben first asked us to ponder: what is sound? For Ben, it’s the neurological, psychological, cultural, social phenomenon that occurs when waves of compression and attenuation hit the insides of your ears. And then the sounds began, starting with a simple sine wave. Ben showed us what happens as you adjust the frequency on the sine wave, and explained that humans can hear frequencies ranging from 20 to 20,000 Hz.</p> <p>(Did you know? <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129581152">There’s a device</a> businesses (like malls) can use to emit “a high-pitched sound that drives teens crazy but can’t be heard by most adults over 25.” It’s called “The Mosquito.”)</p> <p>Ben then introduced us to control voltage, envelopes, voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs), voltage-controlled amplifiers (VCAs), and low frequency oscillators (LFOs). Look them up if you want to know more, but here’s the kind of sounds they make:</p> <audio preload="none" style="width: 100%" controls="controls"><source type="audio/mpeg" src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/ben-synths.mp3?_=1"><a href="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/ben-synths.mp3">https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/ben-synths.mp3</a></audio> <audio preload="none" style="width: 100%" controls="controls"><source type="audio/mpeg" src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/bsynths5.mp3?_=2"><a href="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/bsynths5.mp3">https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/bsynths5.mp3</a></audio> <p>All of these effects conspire to produce the “timbre,” which is the quality of the sound produced by the distribution of frequencies within it. And you can add filters — like “low-pass,” “high-pass,” “bandpass,” and “notch” filters — to create even more interesting sound effects, like the effect created by a wah-wah pedal.

For each, Yunhan offered a detailed overview of tools and key findings.</p> <p>\1. <em>Syntactic Analysis</em>. Yunhan analyzed the relative frequencies with which different verb tenses and parts of speech occur across the Aeneid’s 12 books. Her results lent insight into the “shape” of the epic’s narrative, as well as its stylistic character in relation to other works.</p> <p>\2. <em>Sentiment Analysis</em>. Yunhan used sentiment analysis tools to examine the Aeneid’s emotional arc, analyze the normative descriptive treatment of its heroes and villains, and differentiate—following more conventional classics scholarship—the tonality of its books.</p> <p>\3. <em>Topic Modeling</em>. Here, Yunhan subjected existing bipartite and tripartite “partitionings” of the Aeneid to statistical inquiry. By applying sophisticated topic modelling techniques including Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization, she made a compelling case for the tripartite interpretation. In doing so, she added a novel voice to a noteworthy debate in the classics community.</p> <p>\4. <em>Network Analysis</em>. By leveraging statistical tools to analyze the coincidence of and interactions between the Aeneid’s many characters, Yunhan generated a number of compelling visualizations mapping narrative progression between books in terms of relationships.</p> <p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/big.gif" alt=""></p> <p>In the closing minutes of her presentation, Yunhan reflected on the broader implications of the digital humanities for the study of classics. While some scholars remain skeptical of the digital humanities, Yunhan sees enormous potential for collaboration and coevolution between the new way and the old.</p> </div> <footer> <span class="category"><a href="/blog/category/friday-fundays">Friday Fundays</a></span> <span class="category"><a href="/blog/category/lil-talks">LIL talks</a></span> </footer> </article> </div> <div class="sleeve"> <article itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"> <header> <time class="post-date" datetime="2017-05-09T16:00:43+00:00">May 9, 2017</time> <h2 class="post-title" itemprop="headline"> <a href="/blog/2017/05/09/lil-talks-1924-democratic-convention-by-caitlin/">LIL Talks: 1924 Democratic Convention by Caitlin</a></h2> <p class="post-author">Posted by <a href="/about/#casey-gruppioni">Casey Gruppioni</a></p> </header> <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <p>On May 5th, 2017 Caitlin went in depth on the intricacies of the 1924 Democratic Convention (also known as the ‘Klanbake’).</p> <p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/caitlin1.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>In the 20s the democratic primary had a significantly different process than it does today.

Like most towns in Vermont we have an annual <a href="https://www.sec.state.vt.us/kids/town_mtg.html">Town Meeting</a>. We vote by Australian Ballot on things like budgets, but there’s time at the end of the meeting for Other Business. This year we discussed whether Randolph should become a sanctuary town. Another topic was the annual publication of the names of people who hadn’t paid their taxes at the time of the town report’s publication. I can remember being a kid and seeing these names in my own hometown town report, often of our town’s poorest residents. I always found the “name and shame” aspect of it troubling, though I know that others feel this is a necessary sanction to insure that taxes get paid promptly.</p> <p>At this year’s Town Meeting we discussed whether the town should continue to publish the names of people with delinquent taxes in the town report. Delinquent taxes make up about 3% of the town’s tax revenue. You can see the list yourself, it’s on <a href="http://randolphvt.org/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC=%7B5C28F8A3-18E7-4D10-885B-A33EA106E9F8%7D&amp;DE=">page 35 of this 37 MB document</a>. People had varying opinions of the positive or negative aspects of this practice. A few people said “We’ve always done it that way.” I rarely speak at Town Meeting–I feel my opinions are often already well-represented–but this time I asked to speak and said “We may have always done it this way, but the world has changed. The town now puts the PDF of the town report online which it has been doing since 2010. This means it’s potentially indexed by Google which has been indexing PDFs for the past few years. People who are late on taxes are now perpetually Googleable as scofflaws.”</p> <p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/jessamyn_speaks-768x510.jpg" alt=""> <em>(Photo by Ramsey Papp. Used with permission.)</em></p> <p>I should note at this point that I am aware that there are <a href="http://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/14520/how-to-prevent-a-pdf-file-from-being-indexed-by-search-engines">technical solutions</a> for avoiding Google indexing that are not realistic within the scope of how our town manages their web content.</p> <p>I went on to say that the people who show up on these lists are often people having trouble; two of the listings from this year are a man and his estate, clearly a person who has died. Most of the people in my area, especially my older, poorer and more rural neighbors, have almost no online footprint. This would give them one, a bad one. I concluded “We should not do this to them.”</p> <p>The vote was close, the voice vote wasn’t conclusive so we had to do a standing vote. In the end we recommended that the selectboard look into discontinuing this practice. We might even wind up with some sort of compromise solution like the names being posted in the Town Hall but not on the internet. The fight for privacy, online and offline, is taking place everywhere. Make sure you speak up when you see a way that you could help.</p> </div> <footer> </footer> </article> </div> <div class="sleeve"> <article itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"> <header> <time class="post-date" datetime="2017-03-06T16:00:43+00:00">March 6, 2017</time> <h2 class="post-title" itemprop="headline"> <a href="/blog/2017/03/06/lil-talks-ania/">LIL Talks: Ania</a></h2> <p class="post-author">Posted by <a href="/about/#brett-johnson">Brett Johnson</a></p> </header> <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <p>We were fortunate to have Harvard scholar (and LIL friend) <a href="http://complit.fas.harvard.edu/people/anna-aizman">Ania Aizman</a> talk to us about Anarchism.
