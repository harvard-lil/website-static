E-books are shifting from e-readers to apps as the platform of choice. Google's Android Market has surpassed 100,000 apps despite a problematic payment structure. And Apple, with its upcoming release of Mac OS X Lion, is moving apps from the device to the desktop.</p> <p>Here in the lab, we've talked app development, but with little traction. Why no squealing tires, no fire? Why does spending even a little of our resources on app development feel so wrong? I don't know. But, it takes only a mention of HTML5 to uncover bubbling excitement at the possibilities and to discover we've already begun expending resources.</p> <p>Apps are not here. I wonder what we're missing? Are apps a dead-end? of limited utility to academia?

Go Emily!</p> <p>Written by Anthony Grafton and Jeffrey Hamburger, it is titled "Save the Warburg Library!".  In it, they explain the crisis the Warburg is in financially (hence the title).  But more importantly, they describe what makes this Art History library so unique—the cataloging scheme.  The stacks are open, and the juxtaposition of books "will bring the reader not only to the books he or she is looking for, but also to their unexpected 'good neighbours'."</p> <p><a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/sep/30/save-warburg-library/">http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/sep/30/save-warburg-library/</a></p> <p>From the Warburg Institute Library's <a href="http://warburg.sas.ac.uk/mnemosyne/entrance.htm">web site</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The 350,000 or so volumes are classified in four sections: socia and political history (fourth floor); religion, history of science and philosophy (third and fourth floors); literature, books, libraries and education (second floor and basement); history of art (first floor, with classical art and archaeology in the basement). There are c. 2,500 runs of periodicals, about half of them current (mobile stacks in the basement). Readers have free access to the Library Holdings.</p> </blockquote> <p>Needless to say, this is very different from how the Library of Congress organizes things.  But who's to say that the LC system is better?  Different researchers have different needs, so this begs the question: <em>Can we make Harvard's collection "look" like the Warburg's?</em></p> <p>I've been looking into visualizations book collections, so what if we rendered a shelf of virtual books based on the Warburg logic?  Or Princeton Univerity's Richardson system which groups all the books by each author together?</p> <p>What are the benefits to our library singing Karaoke?</p> </div> <footer> </footer> </article> </div> <div class="sleeve"> <article itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"> <header> <time class="post-date" datetime="2010-09-21T19:53:28+00:00">September 21, 2010</time> <h2 class="post-title" itemprop="headline"> <a href="/blog/2010/09/21/on-the-communication-of-scale-and-respect/">On the communication of scale.
