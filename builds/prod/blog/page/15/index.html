face.</a></h2> <p class="post-author">Posted by <a href="/about/#jeff-goldenson">Jeff Goldenson</a></p> </header> <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <p>On off moments over this summer, Annie and I have put together our new site.  You know, splashed some water on our face.</p> <p>That's what you're looking at.  LiL, freshened up.</p> <p>The goals:</p> <ol> <li>Freshen up our look</li> <li>Mobile-friendly</li> <li>Make it really easy to add stuff, but no big-time CMS nonsense</li> <li>Fun</li> <li>Shareable</li> </ol> <p><strong>1)</strong> We'd built the original site about two years ago—a long time in internet time.  It worked, but it was a bit heavy and very fixed.  We wanted to lighten up things a bit.  Annie ended up on <a href="http://2x4.org/">2x4's website</a> and that started everything off.</p> <p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2012/08/2x4.png" alt="">As you'll no doubt see, our homepage is HEAVILY inspired by 2x4's work.  Ours is less refined, but gets at the general idea of a long pane of scattershot (but underlying grid adhering) images.</p> <p><strong>2)</strong> By now, a lot of the web has been <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrapped</a>—folks everywhere have built their websites using Twitter's recently open source web framework, Bootstrap.  There are a lot of reasons for this, but the primary one is packaging.  They've thrown in nice buttons, cross-browser fixes, and a good responsive grid to make your site work on mobile.  The elegant mobile handling is really why we started on this framework.</p> <p><strong>3)</strong> We wanted the site to be able to change a lot.  And frequently.  At the same time, neither of us wanted to muck around in the CMS worlds of drupal, etc. It's just too complicated.  So we took the wordpress-as-CMS route.  Each project gets its own wordpress "page" that we link to.  Easy to update, manage, etc. We restyled a great, free wordpress theme called <a href="http://320press.com/wpbs/">WordPress Bootstrap</a> by <a href="http://320press.com/">320 Press</a> to make the blog look a lot like every other page.  That way a blog page (which is easy to author) can double as a project page and look pretty natural (nice hack Paul!).</p> <p>Even cooler, Annie came up with a clever system to add all content—people, projects, etc.—info into one, easy-to-understand file (we've called it ingredients.json).   And then those assets ripple through all the pages.  She'll go into it in another post.</p> <p><strong>4)</strong> Everybody seemed to like the mouse-over about us page from our last site.  So we took that and ran with it.  Some, not all, images come to life with a hover.  And some more than others—Jessica's been dabbling in animating some .gif's.  The hover state is not one that ports to mobile.  Any ideas port the fun to these devices?</p> <p><strong>5)</strong> I'd say this is the big point, <em><a href="https://github.com/harvard-lil/website">we wanted to give our site away</a></em>.  Take it. Run with it.  Modify it. Whatever. I got obsessed with the idea of sharing sites whole hog.  The site meets our needs as a lightweight wordpress CMS.  Wordpress was complicated enough. Maybe you find yourself in that position—or just want a pretty simple site that makes hovering things fun. <a href="https://github.com/harvard-lil/website"> It's on github</a>.  It ain't all polished and buffed under the hood, and lot's more documentation to come, but our site's out. Make it your site, or improve it so we can add your changes to our site.</p> <p>The site will take on more and more of its own character over time, but we've rebooted.  And it seems like it's time.</p> </div> <footer> </footer> </article> </div> <div class="sleeve"> <article itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"> <header> <time class="post-date" datetime="2012-07-31T21:44:03+00:00">July 31, 2012</time> <h2 class="post-title" itemprop="headline"> <a href="/blog/2012/07/31/library-e-book-licensing-overview/">Library e-book licensing: overview</a></h2> <p class="post-author">Posted by <a href="/about/#david-weinberger">David Weinberger</a></p> </header> <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <p>The Berkman Center's <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/dobrien">David O'Brien</a>, <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/ugasser/">Urs Gasser</a>, and <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/palfrey/">John Palfrey</a> have just posted a 29-page "<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2111396">briefing paper</a>" on the various models and licenses by which libraries are providing access to e-books.</p> <p>It's not just facts 'n' stats by any means, but here are some anyway:</p> <blockquote> <p>According to the 2011 Library Journal E-Book Survey, 82% of libraries currently offer access to e-books, which reflects an increase of 10 percentage points from 2010. … Libraries maintain an average of 4,350 e-book copies in a collection.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>[T]he publisher-to-library market across all formats and all libraries (e.g., private, public, governmental, academic, research, etc.) is approximately $1.9B; of this, the market for public libraries is approximately $850M</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>92% of libraries use OverDrive as their e-book dealer</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Of the major publishers, only Random House allows unrestricted lending of e-books.</p> </blockquote> <p>I found the section on business models to be particularly clarifying.</p> </div> <footer> <span class="tag"><a href="/blog/tag/e-books">e-books</a></span> <span class="tag"><a href="/blog/tag/ebooks">ebooks</a></span> <span class="tag"><a href="/blog/tag/libraries">libraries</a></span> <span class="tag"><a href="/blog/tag/licenses">licenses</a></span> <span class="category"><a href="/blog/category/ebooks">ebooks</a></span> </footer> </article> </div> <div class="sleeve"> <article itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"> <header> <time class="post-date" datetime="2012-07-23T21:03:02+00:00">July 23, 2012</time> <h2 class="post-title" itemprop="headline"> <a href="/blog/2012/07/23/lil-on-github/">LIL on github</a></h2> <p class="post-author">Posted by <a href="/about/#matt-phillips">Matt Phillips</a></p> </header> <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <p>Group hug at <a href="https://github.com/organizations/harvard-lil">github</a>.</p> <p>We've been loving github lately.

When I'm not feeling up to typing SQL in the Terminal (which is most of the time, scandalous!), I use <a href="http://www.sequelpro.com/">Sequel Pro</a> to interact with MySQL.</p> <p>I use Firefox when web developing.

I just finished up the urban planning masters program over at the <a href="http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/">GSD</a>. I'm hanging out at the lab for the summer, working primarily on<a href="/blog/2012/06/14/timeslice/"> Time/Slice</a>, a project I started in the <a href="http://librarytestkitchen.org/">Library Test Kitchen</a>. The Lab is very awesome.</p> <hr> <p><strong>What hardware do you use?</strong></p> <p>My most important hardware is my pen, which is a rotring extra-fine fountain pen. It was originally quite long; I had one break in my pocket so I sawed off the end and duct taped it. Now it fits in my pocket much better. My other piece of important hardware is a binder clip, which holds together a lot of printer paper full of my calendar, lists, notes, etc.</p> <p>I rely on my MacBook Pro (4,1) for most things. It has a vintage 2008 battery that generates excessive heat, which can be nice in the winter. I also have an i5 iMac that I use for heavier stuff (a lot of GIS). My phone is a Nokia 6315i. The antenna broke off (also a pocket-related accident), so it is super svelte now. I have a Kindle Touch that I like a lot more than I expected to.</p> <p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2012/07/photo-15.jpg" alt="my pen writes well"></p> <p><strong>What software do you use?</strong></p> <p>A lot of Adobe Creative Suite, mostly Illustrator, for design. Other than that, I like free things. For mapping I do use ArcGIS, but I've gotten really into <a href="http://mapbox.com/tilemill/">TileMill</a> recently. It makes maps that are nice and pretty.

I do design and new ideas here at the Lab. The Lab ROCKS! It's a great job. Sometimes I help make websites (like this one), sometimes I do <a href="http://www.librarytestkitchen.org/">classes</a> and right now, even working on some <a href="http://librarylicense.org/">policy-ish stuff</a> with folks from here and the <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/">Berkman Center</a>.</p> <p><strong>What hardware do you use?</strong></p> <p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2012/07/crib.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>I have a mac tower that is cool. I have 2 monitors, that's good.  I also have a Mac Mighty Mouse</p> <p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2012/07/mighty-Mouse2.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>I like the wheel, but gunk does get stuck in it so it requires maintenance.  I'd say the hardware I'm passionate about is the <a href="http://www.gradolabs.com/page_headphones.php?item=f4ba8830232696b5f580bd531134b668">Grado SR60 Headphones</a>.</p> <p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2012/07/sonicPrivacy.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Now those things actually rock. For those with immediate officemates or a quiet atmosphere they are quite acoustically transparent. The other piece of noise control technology I like is earplugs.</p> <p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2012/07/noise-cancelling.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Both of these tools allow me to better get lost in thought…  I've been using earplugs since college, so at this point it's practically associative:  Ear Plugs in = (More) Focus</p> <p>I also drink coffee out of a jar because I can put it in my bag, SEAL IT, and confidently ride to work without it spilling.</p> <p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2012/07/coffee-in-a-jar.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>And that brings me to that ruler in the background.  I like the ruler, it has so many uses.</p> <div class="embed-container"><iframe width="320" height="240" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/45073425" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div> <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/45073425">web site width</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user7144664">Harvard Library Innovation Lab</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p> <p><strong>What software do you use?</strong></p> <p>Adobe Creative Suite, BBEdit, FileZilla, Outlook cause of Harvard U. buy-in, and Spotify.</p> <p><strong>What would be your dream setup</strong></p> <p>I'm curious about that inkling thing.
