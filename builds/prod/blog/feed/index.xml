            <description><![CDATA[<p>We're off to a great start here in Denver at the LITA 2017 Forum.</p>

<p><a href="http://forum.lita.org/speakers/casey-fiesler/">Casey Fiesler</a> set the mood for the afternoon with a provoking discussion of algorithmically-aided decision-making and its effects on our daily lives. Do YouTube's copyright-protecting algorithms necessarily put fetters on Fair Use? Do personalized search results play to our unconscious tendency to avoid things we dislike? Neither "technological solutionism" nor technophobia are adequate responses. Fiesler calls for algorithmic openness (tell us when algorithms are in use, and what are they doing), and for widespread acknowledgment that human psychology and societal factors are deeply implicated as well.</p>

<p>In a concurrent session immediately afterwards, <a href="http://forum.lita.org/speakers/sam-kome/">Sam Kome</a> took a deep dive into the personally identifiable information (PII) his library (and certainly everyone else's) has been unwittingly collecting about their patrons, simply by using today's standard technologies. Kome is examining everything from the bottom up, scrubbing data and putting in place policies to ensure that little or no PII touches his library systems again.</p>

<p><a href="http://forum.lita.org/speakers/jayne-blodgett/">Jayne Blodgett</a> discussed her strategy for negotiating the sometimes tense relationship between libraries and their partners in IT; hot on the heels of the discussion about patron privacy and leaky web services, the importance of this relationship couldn't be more plain.</p>

<p><a href="http://forum.lita.org/speakers/samuel-willis/">Samuel Willis</a> addressed web accessibility and its centrality to the mission of libraries. He detailed his efforts to survey and improve the accessibility of resources for patrons with print disabilities, and offered suggestions for inducing vendors to improve their products. The group pondered how to maintain the privacy of patrons with disabilities, providing the services they require without demanding that they identify themselves as disabled, and without storing that personal information in library systems.</p>

<p>The day screeched to a close with a double-dose of web security awareness: <a href="http://forum.lita.org/speakers/gary-browning">Gary Browning</a> and <a href="http://forum.lita.org/speakers/ricardo-viera/">Ricardo Viera</a> checked the security chops of the audience, and offered practical tips for foiling the hackers who can and do visit our libraries and access our libraries' systems. (Word to the wise: you probably should be blocking any unneeded USB ports in your public-facing technology with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lindy-USB-Port-Blocker-Green/dp/B000I2JWJ0">USB blockers</a>. )</p>

<p>And that's just one path through the many concurrent sessions from this afternoon at LITA.</p>

<p>Looking forward to another whirlwind day tomorrow!</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This is a guest blog post by our summer fellow <a href="http://miglenaminkova.com/">Miglena Minkova</a>.</em></p>

<p>Last week at LIL, I had the pleasure of running a pilot of <strong>git physical</strong>, the first part of a series of workshops aimed at introducing git to artists and designers through creative challenges. In this workshop I focused on covering the basics: <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics">three-tree architecture</a>, simple git workflow, and commands (add, commit, push). These lessons were fairly standard but contained a twist: The whole thing was completely analogue!</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/participants-workshop-1.2-copy-1024x768.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The participants, a diverse group of fellows and interns, engaged in a simplified version control exercise. Each participant was tasked with designing a postcard about their summer at LIL. Following basic git workflow, they took their designs from the working directory, through the staging index, to the version database, and to the remote repository where they displayed them. In the process they “pushed” five versions of their postcard design, each accompanied by a commit note. Working in this way allowed them to experience the workflow in a familiar setting and learn the basics in an interactive and social environment. By the end of the workshop everyone had ideas on how to implement git in their work and was eager to learn more.</p>

<p>Not to mention some top-notch artwork was created.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/IMG_20170802_165639169.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The workshop was followed by a short debriefing session and Q&amp;A.</p>

<p>Check <a href="https://github.com/MMinkova/git-physical">GitHub</a> for more info.</p>

<p>Alongside this overview, I want to share some of the thinking that went behind the scenes.</p>

<p>Starting with some background. Artists and designers perform version control in their work but in a much different way than developers do with git. They often use error-prone strategies to track document changes such as saving files in multiple places using obscure file naming conventions, working in large master files, or relying on in-built software features. At best these strategies result in inconsistencies, duplication and a large disc storage, and at worst, irreversible mistakes, loss of work, and multiple conflicting documents. Despite experiencing some of the same problems as developers, artists and designers are largely unfamiliar with git (exceptions exist).</p>

<p>The impetus for teaching artists and designers git was my personal experience with it. I had not been formally introduced to the concept of version control or git through my studies, nor my work. I discovered git during the final year of my MLIS degree when I worked with an artist to create a modular open source digital edition of an artist’s book. This project helped me see git as an ubiquitous tool with versatile application across multiple contexts and practices, the common denominator of which is making, editing, and sharing digital documents.</p>

<p>I realized that I was faced with a challenge: How do I get artists and designers excited about learning git?</p>

<p>I used my experience as a design educated digital librarian to create relatable content and tailor delivery to the specific characteristics of the audience: highly visual, creative, and non-technical.</p>

<p>Why create another git workshop? There are, after all, plenty of good quality learning resources out there and I have no intention of reinventing the wheel or competing with existing learning resources. However, I have noticed some gaps that I wanted to address through my workshop.</p>

<p>First of all, I wanted to focus on accessibility and have everyone start on equal ground with no prior knowledge or technical skills required. Even the simplest beginner level tutorials and training materials rely heavily on technology and the CLI (Command Line Interface) as a way of introducing new concepts. Notoriously intimidating for non-technical folk, the CLI seems inevitable given the fact that git is a command line tool. The inherent expectation of using technology to teach git means that people need to learn the architecture, terminology, workflow, commands, and the CLI all at the same time. This seems ambitious and a tad unrealistic for an audience of artists and designers.</p>

<p>I decided to put the technology on hold and combine several pedagogies to leverage learning: active learning, learning through doing, and project-based learning. To contextualize the topic, I embedded elements of the practice of artists and designers by including an open ended creative challenge to serve as a trigger and an end goal. I toyed with different creative challenges using deconstruction, generative design, and surrealist techniques. However this seemed to steer away from the main goal of the workshop. It also made it challenging to narrow down the scope, especially as I realized that no single workflow can embrace the diversity of creative practices. At the end, I chose to focus on versioning a combination of image and text in a single document. This helped to define the learning objectives, and cover only one functionality: the basic git workflow.</p>

<p>I considered it important to introduce concepts gradually in a familiar setting using analogue means to visualize black-box concepts and processes. I wanted to employ abstraction to present the git workflow in a tangible, easily digestible, and memorable way. To achieve this the physical environment and set up was crucial for the delivery of the learning objectives.
In terms of designing the workspace, I assigned and labelled different areas of the space to represent the components of git’s architecture. I made use of directional arrows to illustrate the workflow sequence alongside the commands that needed to be executed and used a “remote” as a way of displaying each version on a timeline. Low-tech or no-tech solution such as carbon paper were used to make multiple copies. It took several experiments to get the sketchpad layering right, especially as I did not want to introduce manual redundancies that do little justice to git.</p>

<p>Thinking over the audience interaction, I had considered role play and collaboration. However these modes did not enable each participant to go through the whole workflow and fell short of addressing the learning objectives. Instead I provided each participant with initial instructions to guide them through the basic git workflow and repeat it over and over again using their own design work. The workshop was followed with debriefing which articulated the specific benefits for artists and designers, outlined use cases depending on the type of work they produce, and featured some existing examples of artwork done using git. This was to emphasize that the workshop did not offer a one-size fits all solution, but rather a tool that artists and designers can experiment with and adopt in many different ways in their work.</p>

<p>I want to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/RebeccaCremona">Becky</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cgruppioni">Casey</a> for their editing work.</p>

<p>Going forward, I am planning to develop a series of workshops introducing other git functionality such as basic merging and branching, diff-ing, and more, and tag a lab exercise to each of them. By providing multiple ways of processing the same information I am hoping that participants will successfully connect the workshop experience and git practice.</p>

<p>On Monday Adam and Anastaia presented “<a href="https://eventmobi.com/aall2017/agenda/213084/1115765">Case Law as Data: Making It, Sharing It, Using It</a>“, discussing the CAP project and the exploring ways to use the new legal data the project is surfacing.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/IMG_1015-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>After their presentation they asked those that attended for ideas on how ways to use the data and received an incredible response — over 60 ideas were tossed out by those there!</p>

<p>This year’s AALL was a hot spot of good ideas, conversation and creative thought. Thanks AALL and inland Texas!</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2005, British student Alex Tew had a million-dollar idea. He launched <a href="http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/">www.MillionDollarHomepage.com</a>, a website that presented initial visitors with nothing but a 1000×1000 canvas of blank pixels. At the cost of $1/pixel, visitors could permanently claim 10×10 blocks of pixels and populate them however they’d like. Pixel blocks could also be embedded with URLs and tooltip text of the buyer’s choosing.</p>

<p>The site took off, raising a total of $1,037,100 (the last 1,000 pixels were auctioned off for $38,100). Its customers and content demonstrate a massive range of variation, from individuals bragging about their disposable income to payday loan companies and media promoters. Some purchased minimal 10×10 blocks, while others strung together thousands of pixels to create detailed graphics. The biggest graphic on the page, a chain of pixel blocks purchased by a seemingly defunct domain called “pixellance.com”, contains $10,800 worth of pixels.</p>

<small>The largest graphic on the Million Dollar Homepage, an advertisement for www.pixellance.com</small></p>

<p>While most of the graphical elements on the Million Dollar Homepage are promotional in nature, it seems safe to say that the buying craze was motivated by a deeper fixation on the site’s perceived importance as a digital artifact. A banner at the top of the page reads “Own a Piece of Internet History,” a fair claim given the coverage that it received in the blogosphere and in the popular press. To buy a block of pixels was, in theory, to leave one’s mark on a collective accomplishment reflective of the internet’s enormous power to connect people and generate value.</p>

<p>But to what extent has this history been preserved? Does the Million Dollar Homepage represent a robust digital artifact 12 years after its creation, or has it fallen prey to the ephemerality common to internet content? Have the forces of link rot and administrative neglect rendered it a shell of its former self?</p>

<h2 id="the-site">The Site</h2>

<p>On the surface, there is little amiss with <a href="http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/">www.MillionDollarHomepage.com</a>. Its landing page retains its early 2000’s styling, save for an embedded twitter link in the upper left corner. The (now full) pixel canvas remains intact, saturated with the eye-melting color palettes of an earlier internet era. Overall, the site’s landing page gives the impression of having been frozen at the time of its completion.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/homepage_cap.jpg" alt="" />
<small>A screenshot of the Million Dollar Homepage captured in July of 2017</small></p>

<p>However, efforts to access the other pages linked on the site’s navigation bar return unformatted 404 messages. The “contact me” link redirects to the creator’s Twitter page. It seems that the site has been stripped of its functional components, leaving little but the content of the pixel canvas itself.</p>

<p>Still, the canvas remains a largely intact record of the aesthetics and commercialization patterns of the internet circa 2005. It is populated by pixelated representations of clunky fonts, advertisements for sketchy looking internet gambling sites, and promises of risqué images. Many of the pixel blocks bear a familial resemblance to today’s clickbait banner ads, with scantily clothed models and promises of free goods and content. Of course, this eye-catching pixel art serves a specific purpose: to get the user to click, redirecting to a site of the buyer’s choosing. What happens when we do?</p>

<h2 id="the-links">The Links</h2>

<p>Internet links are not always permanent. As pages are deleted or renamed, backends are restructured, and domain namespaces change hands, previously reachable content and resources can be replaced by 404 pages. This “link rot” is the target of the Library Innovation Lab’s <a href="http://lil.law.harvard.edu/projects/perma-cc/">Perma.cc project</a>, which allows individuals and institutions to create archived snapshots of webpages hosted at a trustable, static URLs.</p>

<p>Over the decade or so since the Million Dollar Homepage sold its last pixel, link rot has ravaged the site’s embedded links. Of the 2,816 links that embedded on the page (accounting for a total of 999,400 pixels), 547 are entirely unreachable at this time. A further 489 redirect to a different domain or to a domain resale portal, leaving 1,780 reachable links. Most of the domains to which these links correspond are for sale or devoid of content.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen-Shot-2017-07-23-at-1.18.33-PM.png" alt="" />

Pixel blocks shaded in red link to unreachable or entirely empty pages, blocks shaded in blue link to domain redirects, and blocks shaded in green are reachable (but are often for sale or have limited content) [Note: this image replaces a previous image which was not colorblind-safe]</small></p>

<p>The 547 unreachable links are attached to graphical elements that collectively take up 342,000 pixels (face value: $342,000). Redirects account for a further 145,000 pixels (face value: $145,000). While it would take a good deal of manual work to assess the reachable pages for content value, the majority do not seem to reflect their original purpose. Though the Million Dollar Homepage’s pixel canvas exists as a largely intact digital artifact, the vast web of sites which it publicizes has decayed greatly over the course of time.</p>

<p>The decay of the Million Dollar Homepage speaks to a pressing challenge in the field of digital archiving. The meaning of a digital artifact to a viewer or researcher is often dependent on the accessibility of other digital artifacts with which it is linked or otherwise networked — a troubling proposition given the inherent dynamism of internet links and addresses. The process of archiving a digital object does not, therefore, necessarily end with the object itself.</p>

<p>What, then, is to be done about the Million Dollar Homepage? While it has clear value as an example of the internet’s ever-evolving culture, emergent potential, and sheer bizarreness, the site reveals itself to be little more than an empty directory upon closer inspection. For the full potential of the Million Dollar Homepage as an artifact to be realized, the web of sites which it catalogues would optimally need to be restored as it existed when the pixels were sold. Given the existence of powerful and widely accessible tools such as the Wayback machine, this kind of restorative curation may well be within reach.</p>

<p>This week, LIL’s resident comic (and staff member) Brett Johnson taught a room full of LIL staff, interns, and fellows the finer intricacies of stand up comedy, which included the construction of a set, joke writing, and the challenges and high points of the craft.</p>

<p>As one example, Brett showed and broke down multiple jokes into the core structure of setup and punch line (or, platform and dismount) for analysis. Additionally, we were also given an insight into the industry where we often take for granted the sheer amount of work, honing, and refining that goes into a set.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/IMG_20170707_143742_sm-1024x768.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We also explored what it meant to be a comic, and how the immediacy of audience reaction and enjoyment means that stand up comedy is one of the only art forms with an extremely evident (and sometimes, brutal) line between success and failure.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/Burst_Cover_GIF_Action_20170707141317_sm.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>Though the talk was littered with choice jokes and funny bits, we definitely came away with a refreshing look into some aspects of stand-up comedy that rarely goes noticed.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On day three of <a href="http://netpreserve.org/">IIPC</a> 2017 (<a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu/blog/2017/06/15/iipc-2017-day-one/">day 1</a>, <a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu/blog/2017/06/16/iipc-2017-day-two/">day 2</a>), we heard more about what I see as the two main themes of the conference: archives users and metadata for provenance.</p>

<p>On the user front, I’ll point out Sumitra Duncan’s talk on <a href="http://discovery.nyarc.org/">NYARC Discovery</a>; like <a href="http://webarchives.ca/">WALK</a>, presented yesterday, this project aggregates search across multiple archives, improving access for users. Peter Webster of <a href="https://websterresearchconsulting.com/">Webster Research &amp; Consulting</a> and Chris Fryer from the <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/parliamentary-archives/">Parliamentary Archives</a> spoke about their study of the archive’s users: the questions of what users want and need, and how they actually use the archive, are fundamental. How we think archives should or could be used may not be as pertinent as we imagine…</p>

<p>On the metadata front, Emily Maemura and Nicholas Worby from the University of Toronto spoke about the ways in which documentation and curatorial process affect users’ experience of and access to archives — the staffing history of a collecting organization, for example, could be an important part of understanding why a web archive contains what it does. Jackie Dooley (OCLC Research), Alexis Antracoli (Princeton University), and Karen Stoll Farrell (Frick Art Reference Library) presented their work on developing web archiving metadata best practices to meet user needs — and it becomes clear that my two main themes could really be seen as one. <a href="http://www.oclc.org/research.html">OCLC Research</a> will issue their reports in July.</p>

<p>I’ll also point out Nicholas Taylor’s excellent talk on the legal use cases for archives, and, of course, LIL’s Anastasia Aizman and Matt Phillips, who gave a super talk on their ongoing work on comparing web archives. Thanks again, and hope to see you all next year!</p>

<p>After the break, the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive’s</a> Jefferson Bailey roared through a presentation of IA’s new tools, including systems for analysis, search, capture (<a href="https://github.com/internetarchive/brozzler!">Brozzler</a>, and availability. Mat Kelly from Old Dominion University described three tools for enabling non-techical users to create, index, and view web archives: <a href="http://warcreate.com/">WARCreate</a>, <a href="http://matkelly.com/wail">WAIL</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/machawk1/mink">Mink</a>. Lozana Rossenova and Ilya Kreymer of Rhizome demonstrated the use of containerized browsers for playback of web content that is no longer usable in modern browsers (think Java applets), as well as some upcoming features in <a href="https://webrecorder.io/">Webrecorder</a> for patching content into incomplete captures.</p>

<p>Following lunch, Fernando Melo and João Nobre from <a href="http://arquivo.pt/">Arquivo.pt </a> described their new APIs for search and temporal analysis of Portuguese web archives. Nicholas Taylor of Stanford University Libraries talked about the ongoing rearchitecture of <a href="https://www.lockss.org/">LOCKSS</a> (Lots of Copies Keep Stuff Safe), expanding its role from a focus on the archiving of electronic journals to a tool for preserving web archives and other digital objects more generally. (In the Q&amp;A, LOCKSS founder David Rosenthal mentioned the article “<a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1920261.1920299">Familiarity breeds contempt</a>: the honeymoon effect and the role of legacy code in zero-day vulnerabilities”.) Jefferson Bailey returned, along with Naomi Dushay, also from the Internet Archive, to talk about <a href="https://github.com/WASAPI-Community/data-transfer-apis">WASAPI</a> (the Web Archiving Systems API) for transfer of data between archives.</p>

<p>After another break, LIL’s own Jack Cushman took the stage with Ilya Kreymer for a fantastic presentation of <a href="http://warc.games/">warc.games</a>, a tool for exploring security issues in web archives: serving a captured web page is very much akin to hosting attacker-supplied content, and warc.games provides a series of challenges for trying out different kinds of attacks against a simplified local web archive. Mat Kelly then returned with David Dias of <a href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol Labs</a> to discuss <a href="https://github.com/oduwsdl/ipwb">InterPlanetary Wayback</a>, which stores web archive files in <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a>, the InterPlanetary File System. Finally, Andrew Jackson wrapped up the session by leading a discussion of planning for an IIPC hackathon or other mechanism for gathering to code.</p>

<p>Thanks, all, for another excellent day!</p>

<p>The conference kicked off at on Wednesday, June 14, at 9:00 with coffee, snacks, and familiar faces from all parts of the world. Web archives bring us together physically!</p>

<small>So many people to meet. So many collaborators to greet!</small></p>

<p><strong>Jane Winters</strong> and <strong>Nic Taylor</strong> welcomed. It’s wonderful to converse and share in this space — grand, human, bold, warm, strong. Love the Senate House at <a href="http://www.london.ac.uk/">University of London</a>. Thank you so much for hosting us!</p>

<p><strong>Leah Lievrouw</strong>, <a href="http://www.ucla.edu/">UCLA</a>
Web history and the landscape of communication/media research</p>

<p><a href="http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/llievrou/LeahLievrouw/Welcome.html">Leah</a> told us that computers are viewed today as a medium — as human communication devices. This view is common now, but hasn’t been true for too long. Computers as a medium was very fringe even in the early 80s.</p>

<p>We walked through a history of communications to gain more understanding of computers as human communication devices and started with some history of information organization and sharing.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Otlet">Paul Otlet</a> pushed efforts forward to organize all of the world’s information in the late 19th century Belgium and France.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Books/World-Made-Safe-Differences-Intellectuals/0585378444">The Coldwar Intellectuals</a></em> by J Light describes how networked information moved from the government and the military to the public.</p>

<p>And, how that network information became interesting when it was push and pull —
 send an email and receive a response, or send a message on a UNIX terminal to another user and chat. Computers are social machines, not just calculating machines.
Leah took us through how the internet and early patterns of the web were formed by the time and the culture — in this case, the incredible activity of Stanford, Berkley. Mileu of the Bay Area — bits and boolean logic through psychedelics. Fred Turner’s <em><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Counterculture-Cyberculture-Stewart-Network-Utopianism/dp/0226817423">From Counterculture to Cyberculture</a></em> is a fantastic read on this scene.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Brand">Stewart Brand</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson">Ted Nelson</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WELL">WELL online community</a>, and so on.</p>

<p>We’re still talking about way before the web here. The idea of networked information was there, but we didn’t have a protocol (http) or a language (html) being used (web browser) at large scale (the web). <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wired-Cities-Shaping-Communications-Library/dp/0816118515">Wired Cities</a></em> by Dutton, Blumer, Kraemer sounds like a fantastic read to understand how mass wiring/communication made the a massive internet/web a possibility!</p>

<p><em><a href="http://memex.org/licklider.pdf">The Computer as Communication Device</a></em> described by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._C._R._Licklider">J.C.R. Licklider</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Taylor_(computer_scientist)">Bob Taylor</a> was a clear vision to the future — we’re still not at a place where computers understand us as humans, we’re still are fairly rigid with defined request and responses patterns.</p>

<p>The web was designed to access, create docs, that’s it. Early search engines and browsers exchanged discrete documents — we thought about the web as discrete, linked documents.</p>

<p>Then, user generated content came along — wikis, blogs, tagging, social network sites. Now it’s easy for lots of folks to create content and and the network is even more powerful as a communication tool for many people!</p>

<p>The next big phase came with mobile — about mid 2000s. More and more and more people!
Data subject (data cloud or data footprint) is an approach that has felt interesting recently at UCLA. Maybe it’s real-time “flows” rather than “stacks” of docs or content.</p>

<p>Technology as cultural material and material culture.</p>

Advancing access and interface for research use of web archives</p>

<p>Internet Archive is a massive archive! 32 Petabytes (with duplications)</p>

<p>And, they have <a href="https://web-beta.archive.org/">search APIs</a>!!</p>

<p>Holy smokes!!! Broad access to <a href="https://archive.org/web/">wayback</a> without a URL!!!!!!!</p>

<p>IA has been working on a format called WAT. It’s about 20-25% the size of a WARC and contains just about everything (including title, headers, link) except the content. And, it’s a JSON format!</p>

<p>Fun experiments when you have tons of web archives!!! <a href="https://gifcities.org/">Gifcities.org</a> and US Military powerpoints are two gems!</p>

<p>A story about a homepage can be generated using its layout elements — (tables, fonts, and so on). Maybe the web counter and the alert box mark the page in time and can be used to understand the page!</p>

<p>Analysis of data capture cannot be purely technical, has to be socio-technical.</p>

<p>Digital desolation is a term that describes abandoned sites on the web. Sites that haven’t been restyled. Sites age over time. (Their wrinkles are frames and table !!?? lol)</p>

<p>Old sites might not bubble to the top in today’s search engines — they’re likely at the long tail of what is returned. You have to work to find good old pages.</p>

<p><strong>Ralph Schroederucla</strong>, <a href="https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/">Oxford Internet Institute</a></p>

<p>Web Archives and and theories of the web</p>

<p>Ralph is looking at how information is used and pursued.
How do you seek information? Not many people ask this core question. Some interesting researcher (anyone know?) in Finland does thought. He sits down with folks and asks “how do you think about getting information when you’re just sitting in your house? How does your mind seek information?”</p>

<p>Googlearchy — a few sites exist that dominate!</p>

<p>You can look down globally at which websites dominate the attention space. The idea that we’d all come together in a one global culture, that hasn’t happened yet — instead, there’s been a slow crystallization of different clusters.</p>

<p>It used to be an anglo-ization of the web, now things may have moved to the South Asian — Angela Wu talks about this.</p>

<p>Some measurements show that American and Chinese devote their attention to about the same bubble of websites — it might be that Americans are no more outward looking than are Chinese.</p>

<p>We need a combined quantitative and qualitative study of web attention — we don’t access the web by typing in a URL (unless you’re in internet archive) we go to Google.</p>

<p>It’s hard to know about internet as a human right.</p>

<p>Maybe having reliable information about health could be construed as civil rights.</p>

<p>And unreliable, false information goes against human rights.</p>

<small>London is a delightful host for post-conference wanderings</small></p>

<p>Oh, dang, it’s lunch already. It’s been a fever of web archiving!</p>

<p>We have coverage at this year’s IIPC! What a fantastic way to attend a conference — with the depth and breadth of much of the Perma.cc team!</p>

<p>Anastasia Aizman, Becky Cremona, Jack Cushman, Brett Johnson, Matt Phillips, and Ben Steinberg are in attendance this year.</p>

<p>The authors conducted a survey of 35 master thesis from University of Copenhagen found that there were 899 web refs, 26.4 web refs on avg, 0 min, 80 max.</p>

<p>About 80% of links in theses were not dated or loosely dated — urls without dates are not reliable for citations?</p>

<p>Students are not consistent when they refer to web material, even if they followed well known style guides.
The speakers studied another corpus — 10 danish academic monographs and found similar variation around citations. Maybe we can work toward a good reference style?</p>

<p>Form of suggested reference might be something like</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">PWID: Persistent web identifier <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WAWeek2017?src=hash">#WAWeek2017</a> <br />(personal consideration: i feel perplexed with the idea of new identifiers) <a href="https://t.co/sYmvDhTXcx">pic.twitter.com/sYmvDhTXcx</a></p>&mdash; Raffaele Messuti (@atomotic) <a href="https://twitter.com/atomotic/status/874981023855116288">June 14, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Where page is the content coverage, or thing the author is citing. Fantastic!</p>

<p>What if we were to make the content coverage in a fragment identifier (the stuff after the # in the address? Maybe something like this,</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>web.archive.org/&lt;timestamp&gt;/&lt;url&gt;#&lt;content coverage&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<small>And totally unrelated, this fridge was spotted later that day on the streets of London. We need a fridge in LIL. Probably not worth shipping back though.</small></p>

<p><strong>Some Author</strong>, some organization</p>

<p>The UK Web Archive has been actively grabbing things from the web since 2004.</p>

<p>Total collection of 400 TB of UK websites only, imposing a “territorial” boundary — .uk, .scot, .cymru, etc.</p>

<p>Those TLDs are not everything though — if the work is made available from a website with a uk domain name or that person is physically based in uk</p>

<small>Recap, decompress, and keep the mind active for day two of IIPC!</small></p>

<p>The day was full of energy, ideas, and friendly folks sharing their most meaningful work. An absolute treat to be here and share our work! Two more days to soak up!</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, Jack Cushman illustrated how hard it is to make a film, or rather, how easy it is to make a bad film. With the assistance of LIL staff and interns, he directed a tiny film of four lines in about four minutes, then used it as a counter-example. Any mistake can break the suspension of disbelief, and amateurs are likely to make many mistakes. Infelicities in shot selection, lighting, sound, wardrobe and makeup, set design, editing, color, and so on destroy the viewer’s immersion in the film.</p>

<p>An example is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/180-degree_rule">180-degree rule</a>: in alternating shots over the shoulders of two actors facing each other, the cameras must remain on the same side of the imaginary line joining the two actors. Breaking this rule produces cuts where the spatial relationship of the two actors appears to change from shot to shot.</p>

<p>After some discussion of the differences between our tiny film and <em>Star Wars</em>, Jack gauged his crew’s enthusiasm, and directed another attempt, taking only slightly longer to shoot than the first try. Here are some stills from the set.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week Ben Steinberg took us on a strange and magical trip through the world of synthesizers.</p>

<p>Ben wasn’t talking about those Casio keyboards we all had as kids:</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/synth0-768x576.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>No, he was talking about this kind of thing … a self-built modular synthesizer:</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/syth1-768x1024.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Before showing off the hardware, Ben first asked us to ponder: what is sound? For Ben, it’s the neurological, psychological, cultural, social phenomenon that occurs when waves of compression and attenuation hit the insides of your ears.
And then the sounds began, starting with a simple sine wave. Ben showed us what happens as you adjust the frequency on the sine wave, and explained that humans can hear frequencies ranging from 20 to 20,000 Hz.</p>

<p>(Did you know? <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129581152">There’s a device</a> businesses (like malls) can use to emit “a high-pitched sound that drives teens crazy but can’t be heard by most adults over 25.” It’s called “The Mosquito.”)</p>

<p>Ben then introduced us to control voltage, envelopes, voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs), voltage-controlled amplifiers (VCAs), and low frequency oscillators (LFOs). Look them up if you want to know more, but here’s the kind of sounds they make:</p>

<audio preload="none" style="width: 100%;" controls="controls"><source type="audio/mpeg" src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/ben-synths.mp3?_=1" /><a href="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/ben-synths.mp3">https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/ben-synths.mp3</a></audio>

<audio preload="none" style="width: 100%;" controls="controls"><source type="audio/mpeg" src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/bsynths5.mp3?_=2" /><a href="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/bsynths5.mp3">https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/bsynths5.mp3</a></audio>

<p>All of these effects conspire to produce the “timbre,” which is the quality of the sound produced by the distribution of frequencies within it. And you can add filters — like “low-pass,” “high-pass,” “bandpass,” and “notch” filters — to create even more interesting sound effects, like the effect created by a wah-wah pedal. And if that’s not enough, Ben showed us a cool, minimalistic interface called a monome grid, which you can use to trigger different sound patterns and effects:</p>

<div style="width: 580px;"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video width="580" height="326" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/monome1.mp4?_=1" /><a href="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/monome1.mp4">https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/monome1.mp4</a></video></div>

<p>Ben wrapped up with a discussion of the “most interesting” sounds. To him, these are the ones that aren’t simulating other sounds and don’t sound like anything else. They sound like “machines playing themselves.”</p>

<p>For a sample, visit Ben’s own sound machine on the web: <a href="http://partytronic.com/">http://partytronic.com/</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks Ben!</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s LIL talk, Matt Phillips gave us an effervescent presentation on Seltzer, followed by a tasting.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/IMG_4202.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We tasted</p>

<ul>
  <li>Perrier – minerally, slightly salty, big bubbles with medium intensity</li>
  <li>Saratoga – varied bubble size, clean… Paul says that this reminds him of typical German seltzers</li>
  <li>Poland Springs – soft, smooth, sweet and clean</li>
  <li>Gerolsteiner – Minerally with low carbonation</li>
  <li>Borjomi – Graphite, very minerally, small bubbles, funk</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/matt_seltzer.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>Of course, throughout the conversation, we discussed the potential for the bottles affecting our opinions. We agreed that for a truly objective comparison, we’d transfer the samples to generic containers.</p>

<p>Though our tech and law talks are always educational and fun, our carbonated water talk was a refreshing change.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(<em>This is a guest post by John Bowers, a student at Harvard College who is collaborating with us on the Entropy Project. John will be a <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/getinvolved/internships">Berktern</a> here this Summer.</em>)</p>

<p>In last week’s LIL talk, team member and graduating senior Yunhan Xu shared some key findings from her prize-winning thesis “A Small Study of Epic Proportions: Toward a Statistical Reading of the <em>Aeneid</em>.” As an impressive entry into the evolving “digital humanities” literature, Yunhan’s thesis blended the empirical rigor of statistical analysis with storytelling and interpretive methods drawn from the study of classics.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/580544E2-0F07-4B16-AE66-C020073BF4EB-768x576.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The presentation dealt with four analytical methodologies applied in the thesis. For each, Yunhan offered a detailed overview of tools and key findings.</p>

<p>\1. <em>Syntactic Analysis</em>. Yunhan analyzed the relative frequencies with which different verb tenses and parts of speech occur across the Aeneid’s 12 books. Her results lent insight into the “shape” of the epic’s narrative, as well as its stylistic character in relation to other works.</p>

<p>\2. <em>Sentiment Analysis</em>. Yunhan used sentiment analysis tools to examine the Aeneid’s emotional arc, analyze the normative descriptive treatment of its heroes and villains, and differentiate—following more conventional classics scholarship—the tonality of its books.</p>

<p>\3. <em>Topic Modeling</em>. Here, Yunhan subjected existing bipartite and tripartite “partitionings” of the Aeneid to statistical inquiry. By applying sophisticated topic modelling techniques including Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization, she made a compelling case for the tripartite interpretation. In doing so, she added a novel voice to a noteworthy debate in the classics community.</p>

<p>\4. <em>Network Analysis</em>. By leveraging statistical tools to analyze the coincidence of and interactions between the Aeneid’s many characters, Yunhan generated a number of compelling visualizations mapping narrative progression between books in terms of relationships.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/big.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>In the closing minutes of her presentation, Yunhan reflected on the broader implications of the digital humanities for the study of classics. While some scholars remain skeptical of the digital humanities, Yunhan sees enormous potential for collaboration and coevolution between the new way and the old.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On May 5th, 2017 Caitlin went in depth on the intricacies of the 1924 Democratic Convention (also known as the ‘Klanbake’).</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/caitlin1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>In the 20s the democratic primary had a significantly different process than it does today. Back then only 12 state had primaries, the rest of the delegates were selected through state-level caucuses and conventions that were tightly controlled by political machines.</p>

<p>Going into the Primary, the ecosystem of the United States was divided and often heated. At a glance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Prohibition had been in effect since 1920 and there were 20,000+ violation cases. Coincidentally grape juice sales skyrocketed during this time.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Coolidge signed the immigration act of 1924 which limited the number of immigrants admitted into the US to 2% of people from that country that were living in the US as of the 1870 census. This was primarily aimed at Southern &amp; Eastern Europeans (ie: Italians and Jews). Immigrants from Africa and Asia were outright banned.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ku Klux Klan was at its peak with an estimated 3–8 million members. The Klan’s platform at that time was to have a country that was white, Protestant and immigrant-free.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There were two front-runners of the Primary.</p>

<p>William McAdoo:</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen-Shot-2017-05-08-at-5.02.19-PM.png" alt="" />

<p>He was the former treasury secretary in Wilson’s administration and Wilson’s son-in-law. He had the popular vote, was favored by the labor unions and formally accepted the Klan’s support. His supporters were generally: southern, western, rural, Protestant &amp; dry (pro-prohibition)</p>

<p>Governor Al Smith:</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen-Shot-2017-05-08-at-5.02.44-PM.png" alt="" />
<em>Harris &amp; Ewing. (Between 1905 and 1945). Smith, Alfred. Honorable. [Photograph]. Retrieved from http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/hec2009008185/</em></p>

<p>He was the NY Governor at the time and had entered the race primarily block McAdoo for the western &amp; urban political base. He was backed by the NY political machine Tammany Hall, and his supporters were generally: northern, urban, Catholic &amp; wet (anti-prohibition).</p>

<p>The convention was held at Madison Sq Garden on June 24th, 1924. A 2/3 vote was needed to select a candidate and in order to accomplish that the convention lasted for 16 days and 103 ballots until a consensus was reached. The convention was PACKED and the Washington Post described it as full of “Tammany shouters, Yiddish chanters, vaudeville performers, saga Indians, hulu dancers, street cleaners, firemen, policemen, movie actors &amp; actresses, bootleggers, 1,098 delegates and 15 presidential candidates.”</p>

<p>There were fist flights on the floor between pro- and anti-Klan delegates. The Tammany Machine stacked the crowd with paid protestors filling the are with the sounds  of thousands of people with drums, tubas, trumpets and electric fire sirens in support of Smith after FDR gave his nominating speech.</p>

<p>After 16 days neither McAdoo or Smith won. John W. Davis, a candidate from West Virginia, was the eventual compromise.</p>

<p>However in the end it was all for nothing; Calvin Coolidge won the 1924 presidential election and Davis only captured about 26% of the total vote.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In last week’s LIL talk, expert witness Adam Ziegler took the stand to explain the structure of legal opinions and give an overview of our country’s appellate process.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>First on the docket was a general overview of our country’s judicial structure, specifically noting the similarities between our federal and state systems, which both progress from district courts, to appellate courts, to supreme courts.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2_adamated_gif.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>Next, we dissected several cases which would eventually be heard by the US Supreme Court. While some elements, such as a list of attorneys and the opinion text, are standard in all cases, each court individually decides how their cases will be formatted. They are, however, often forced to work within the guidelines and workflows specified by their contracted publishers.</p>

<p>In our <a href="http://lil.law.harvard.edu/projects/caselaw-access-project/">Caselaw Access Project</a>, we’re working on friendlier, faster, totally open, and more data-focused systems for courts to publish opinions.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(<em>This is a guest post from the amazing Jessamyn West, who we’re lucky to have with us this year as a Research Fellow.</em>)</p>

<p>I live in a town of 4500 people. Like most towns in Vermont we have an annual <a href="https://www.sec.state.vt.us/kids/town_mtg.html">Town Meeting</a>. We vote by Australian Ballot on things like budgets, but there’s time at the end of the meeting for Other Business. This year we discussed whether Randolph should become a sanctuary town. Another topic was the annual publication of the names of people who hadn’t paid their taxes at the time of the town report’s publication. I can remember being a kid and seeing these names in my own hometown town report, often of our town’s poorest residents. I always found the “name and shame” aspect of it troubling, though I know that others feel this is a necessary sanction to insure that taxes get paid promptly.</p>

<p>At this year’s Town Meeting we discussed whether the town should continue to publish the names of people with delinquent taxes in the town report. Delinquent taxes make up about 3% of the town’s tax revenue. You can see the list yourself, it’s on <a href="http://randolphvt.org/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC=%7B5C28F8A3-18E7-4D10-885B-A33EA106E9F8%7D&amp;DE=">page 35 of this 37 MB document</a>. People had varying opinions of the positive or negative aspects of this practice. A few people said “We’ve always done it that way.” I rarely speak at Town Meeting–I feel my opinions are often already well-represented–but this time I asked to speak and said “We may have always done it this way, but the world has changed. The town now puts the PDF of the town report online which it has been doing since 2010. This means it’s potentially indexed by Google which has been indexing PDFs for the past few years. People who are late on taxes are now perpetually Googleable as scofflaws.”</p>

<p>I should note at this point that I am aware that there are <a href="http://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/14520/how-to-prevent-a-pdf-file-from-being-indexed-by-search-engines">technical solutions</a> for avoiding Google indexing that are not realistic within the scope of how our town manages their web content.</p>

<p>I went on to say that the people who show up on these lists are often people having trouble; two of the listings from this year are a man and his estate, clearly a person who has died. Most of the people in my area, especially my older, poorer and more rural neighbors, have almost no online footprint. This would give them one, a bad one. I concluded “We should not do this to them.”</p>

<p>The vote was close, the voice vote wasn’t conclusive so we had to do a standing vote. In the end we recommended that the selectboard look into discontinuing this practice. We might even wind up with some sort of compromise solution like the names being posted in the Town Hall but not on the internet. The fight for privacy, online and offline, is taking place everywhere. Make sure you speak up when you see a way that you could help.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Adam shared two different topics on February 24, 2017 — Mardi Gras and how to be deposed.</p>

<p>Adam grew up in New Orleans and it was clear from his talk that the gravity of MG still pulled on him.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/a3-768x495.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Adam reviewed the history of the yearly celebration and highlighted the fascinating tradition of the social orgs that fuel the celebration — the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krewe">krewes</a>.</p>

<p>The thing that stuck with me a week later as i reflect on Adam’s talk — Mardi Gras is different things to different people. For wild, party seeking, spring breakers, it’s one thing. And, for families that march as high school band members, and for community leaders (in and far away from the French Quarter) that network by shaking a ten thousand hands — it’s another thing.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/a1-768x542.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Hard Right Turn — It’s a two for one talk today!!</p>

<p>Adam also used his experience as a practicing litigator to instruct us on how to behave when being deposed. Fascinating!! Adam shared his guidelines — something like,  1/ tell the truth;  2/ take your time when responding to the question;  3/ only respond to the question by being focused in your response.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/a2-1-768x406.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We watched three entertaining and engrossing depositions — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISW3_KT5PeY">Joe Jamail</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_E_kKGvytk">Lil Wayne</a> (oh, I wish he had a library rhyme. please, please, please toss us a bone Lil wayne!!), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dqE9Ns-RJM">Donald Trump</a> — and enjoyed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_cake">king cake</a> and coffee!</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Awesome Box was a highly successful experiment that helped LIL explore new ways of enabling peer to peer reading recommendations in libraries.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/awesome_action.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The Awesome Box was <a href="https://github.com/harvard-lil/awesome/tree/master/django/static/images/box-images">a physical box</a> that a library would sit next to the library’s regular returns box and if you thought the book was mind blowing, you dropped it in the Awesome Box instead of the regular returns box. The librarian then has the option to scan the book into the Awesome Box website to enable digital sharing of lists of awesome items. Or, the librarian can keep things no-tech and put the item on a shelf labelled <em>Community Recommendations</em>.</p>

<p>Annie Cain and I created the Awesome Box after hearing about a similar idea functioning in a European library. In 2013, we developed the web app, received a little grant funding from <a href="https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/liblab/">Harvard’s Library Lab and the Arcadia Fund</a>, and started collaborating with libraries at Harvard, Somerville Public (first Awesome Box in the wild!!), Cambridge Public, and Brookline Public here in the Boston area.</p>

<p>Annie and I (with Annie doing the lion’s share) worked hard to develop the Awesome Box community by quickly replying with advice when emails arrived and talking about Awesome Box at several conferences and gatherings of librarians.</p>

<p>I learned a ton about product development and adoption with the Awesome Box, but two big things that stick out after much reflection — make the thing you’re building fit with the patterns of the folks that will use the thing (people are returning books anyway, they just need to choose a box), and you have to sell, sell, sell! Awesome Box is fun and free (<a href="https://github.com/harvard-lil/awesome">as in open source and as in no money</a>) and we still constantly talked it up and pushed it for three years. I’ve found that it’s hard to find success with a project if you just dump on the web and expect people to use it — you’ve got to wire people to your project.</p>

<p>Awesome Box is certainly one of the most successful projects I’ve been lucky enough to be part of. And, arguably, one of the most successful projects to roll out of LIL. Thank you so much to all the libraries that joined together to make Awesome Box so much fun! If you’re a library and you didn’t have a chance to export your Awesome items, please <a href="mailto:mphillips@law.harvard.edu">drop me an email</a> and I’ll get your data to you.</p>

<p>Awesome Box was an experiment. It’s done and the servers have been powered down. During it’s glorious run, the Awesome Box supported <strong>512 private, public, and academic libraries across the US</strong>. The members of those libraries dropped 104,715 items dropped in the Awesome Box from 2013 to 2016.</p>

<p>Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.</p>

        <title>Physical Pitch Decks</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've been playing with physical pitch decks lately. Slides as printed cards.</p>

<p>PowerPoint, <a href="http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/">Deck.js</a>, and the like are fantastic when sharing with large groups of people — from a classroom full of folks to a web full of folks. But, what if easy and broad sharing isn't a criteria for your pitch deck?</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/12/pitch-med.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>You might end up with physical cards like I did when I recently pitched <a href="/blog/2016/09/02/private-talking-spaces-progress/">Private Talking Spaces</a>. The cards are surprisingly good!! Just like non-physical slides, they can provide outlines for talks and discussions, but they're so simple (just paper and ink), they won't get in the way when sharing ideas with small groups.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/12/IMG_7287.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The operation of the cards is as plain as can be - just take the card off the top, flip it upside down, and put it to the side. </p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/12/IMG_7289.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>n cards = n screens in the world of physical pitch decks. I wish we had multiple projectors in rooms! In the photo above, I pin my agenda card up top.</p>

<p>I drew the slides in Adobe Illustrator. They're six inches square and printed on sturdy paper. If you'd like to make your own, here's <a href="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/pts-pitch.ai">my .ai file</a> and here's <a href="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/pts-pitch.pdf">a .pdf version</a>.</p>

<p>It feels like there's something here. Some depth. If you've had success with physical pitch decks, please <a href="mailto:mphillips@law.harvard.edu">send me pointers</a>. Thanks!!</p>

<p>we hosted a bunch of amazing visitors earlier this week (knight prototype workshop!) and we were fortunate enough to gather everyone for dinner. after drinks were served, i used my phone's camera and swooped into each booth aka pocket of people.</p>

<p>swooping into these pockets of people is surprisingly meaningful and rich — i very much get a distinct sense for the vibe/mood/energy at each table. this swoop in and pan pattern is deep.</p>

<p>what should i do with these clips? feels like there's some coolness here but i can't seem to grab it. ideas?</p>

<p>The Nuremberg Tribunals Project is excited to announce the launch of its new <a href="http://nuremberg.law.harvard.edu">website</a>.</p>

<p>Our team at the Harvard Library Innovation Lab and the Harvard Law Library's Department of Historical and Special Collections has been working hard the past year to create a new, rich, flexible and visually appealing discovery and viewing experience for our 750,000-page Nuremberg Trials archive.  The archive materials comprise the full document record for all 13 Nuremberg Trials, held at Nuremberg 1945-49.  Of those, so far the project has been able to process the materials for 5 of the 13 trials and make them available online.  The documents include all trial exhibits, source materials from which most of the trial exhibits were selected, and the full day-to-day proceedings for each trial as recorded in the trial transcripts.  Also included are several hundred annotated photographs taken of the trial proceedings.</p>

<p>The Harvard Nuremberg collection is one of the few comprehensive document sets available for these trials.  While many institutions possess materials relating to the International Military Tribunal, relatively few have significant archives relating to any or all of the follow-on 12 National Military Tribunals adjudicated by the United States.  Aside from the U.S. National Archives, Harvard is unique in offering access to the full set of materials generated by all 13 Nuremberg trials.</p>

<p>The new website replaces our previous online presence dating from 2003.  Its beautiful, elegantly functional design was created by Frances Duncan and implemented by Emma Cushman, whose open-source project code is available at <a href="https://github.com/harvard-lil/nuremberg">GitHub</a>.  It offers through its new design deep, faceted document and photograph search and full-text keyword transcript search.  Document page images are viewable at a variety of zoom levels, and the transcripts are rendered as both plain text and scanned page images.  All document and transcript page images and transcript full text are downloadable and printable.  The website also offers rich introductory materials to the subject matter of the Trials and document archive as well as detailed introductions to each trial, supporting our goal of making the site useful for the general public as well as researchers in the field.</p>

<p>The Project and website are profiled in the <a href="http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/10/devils-in-the-details/">Harvard Gazette</a>.</p>

<p>The Web project is a multi-year, multi-phase, on-going initiative.  We have completed the digitization work of scanning all the materials into digital format, have completed the conversion of a third of the transcripts into full-text searchable format, and have finished the analytical work of describing in detail the documents for 5 of the 13 trials.  We are actively pursuing outside funding to support expanding the exposure of this unique collection to the world in a fully open and accessible way.</p>

<p>The future of the lab — I saw <a href="http://www.ivanpoupyrev.com/">Ivan Poupyrev</a> talk about about the future of labs. He said a whole bunch of interesting things, but the thing stuck most with me is his advice on staffing a lab. He said something like "Bring in people that are focused on solving a problem. If they have a project you want to support and grow, bring them in and give them space to build that thing." Totally sold on this idea. Projects often need the stamina and focus of a single person (two people feels good too) to jam it through to success.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have a data management dilemma, and we hope that you — data-smart people of the world — can help us out. We need a versioning and change tracking system for around 50 million XML files, and no existing solutions seem to fit.</p>

<h2 id="about-the-project">About The Project</h2>

<p>The Caselaw Access Project or CAP, previously known as Free The Law, is making all U.S. case law freely accessible online. For more information, see  <a href="/projects/caselaw-access-project">our project page</a>, and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/29/us/harvard-law-library-sacrifices-a-trove-for-the-sake-of-a-free-database.html">this New York Times article</a>.</p>

<h2 id="our-tracking-task">Our Tracking Task</h2>

<p>Like most digitization projects, we generate many page images. The binary image files rarely change and are not difficult to track. However, in addition to images, we create rich XML files containing descriptive/structural metadata and OCR. As we uncover mistakes in the OCR, encounter metadata anomalies, and gather new data through CAP-facilitated research projects, we will need to update these files. Tracking those changes is going to be a bit more difficult.</p>

<h3 id="the-files">The Files</h3>

<p>We are scanning about 37,000 volumes. Each volume contains multiple pages (obviously) and multiple cases. Usually, a case takes up a few pages, but some cases are so small that several can fit on one page, so there's no direct parent/child relationship between them. Cases never span volumes.</p>

<p>If you're interested in checking out a case for yourself, you can grab a sample case with all the associated files <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0XytYvCOEw-YU41MWNyVEJfNlE/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

<p>How we split these things up into files:</p>

<h3 id="for-each-volume">For each volume:</h3>
<ul class="lil-list">
  <li>One METS XML file with all volume-level metadata (~ 1 MB  avg)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="for-each-page-side">For each page side:</h3>
<ul class="lil-list">
  <li>One lossless jp2 (~2.5 MB avg)</li>
  <li>One 1-bit tiff (~60 KB avg)</li>
  <li>One <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALTO_(XML)">ALTO v3 XML</a> file (~75 KB avg)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="for-each-case">For each case:</h3>
<ul class="lil-list">
  <li>One METS XML file, which includes the text of each case body, and all case-level metadata (~75 KB avg)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-scale">The Scale</h3>
<ul class="lil-list">
  <li>Roughly 37k volumes, so about 37,000 volume XML files</li>
  <li>Roughly 40mil page-sides, so that many jp2s, tiffs, and ALTO XML files</li>
  <li>A bit fewer than 10 million Cases, so that many Case METS XML files</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="our-key-requirements">Our key requirements:</h2>

<h3 id="data-set-versioning">Data Set Versioning</h3>
<p>Ideally this could be done at the corpus or series level (described below.) This would be useful to researchers working with larger sets of data.</p>

<h3 id="sanitizable-change-tracking">Sanitizable Change Tracking</h3>
<p>As is the case with most change-tracking systems, when recording changes, we usually want to be able to ascertain the state of the data before the change, whether this is by recording the old version and the new version, or the delta between the two versions. However, with some change types, we do require the ability to either delete the delta or the old data state. Ideally, we would be able to do this without removing the entire change history for the file.</p>

<h3 id="file-authentication">File Authentication</h3>
<p>People should be able to check if the version of the file they have is, or ever has been in our repository.</p>

<h3 id="open-data-format">Open Data Format</h3>
<p>Even if the change/versioning data isn't natively stored in an easily human-readable format, it must at least be exportable into a useful open format. No strictly proprietary solutions.</p>

<h3 id="access-control">Access Control</h3>
<p>We have to be able to control access to this data.</p>

<h2 id="our-wish-list">Our Wish List</h2>
<ul class="lil-list">
  <li>FOSS (Free Open Source Software) Based Solution</li>
  <li>Diffing — allow downstream databases to fetch deltas between their current version and the latest</li>
  <li>Minimal system management overhead</li>
  <li>Ability to efficiently distribute change history with the data, ideally in a human-readable format</li>
  <li>XML-aware change tracking, so changes can be applied to XML elements with the same identifiers and content, in different files</li>
  <li>Will automatically detect replacement images</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-weve-considered-and-their-disadvantages">What we've considered, and their disadvantages</h2>

<h3 id="git">Git</h3>
<ul class="lil-list">
  <li>Dataset is much too large to store in a single repository</li>
  <li>Non-plain-text change history</li>
  <li>Redacting a single file requires rewriting large portions of the tree</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="media-wiki">Media Wiki</h3>
<ul class="lil-list">
  <li>Not geared to handle XML data</li>
  <li>Would require storing in a different format/syncing</li>
  <li>Non-plain-text change history</li>
  <li>Provides sanitizable change tracking but no versioning of larger data sets</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="bitkeeper">BitKeeper</h3>
<ul class="lil-list">
  <li>Non-plain-text change history</li>
  <li>Seems to not allow easy sanitization of change history</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dat">Dat</h3>
<ul class="lil-list">
  <li>P2P Architecture doesn't give us enough access control for the first phase of the project.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="something-we-write-ourselves">Something we write ourselves</h3>
<ul class="lil-list">
  <li>Reinvents the wheel, at least in part</li>
  <li>Probably not as efficient as more mature tools</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="should-the-data-be-restructured">Should the data be restructured?</h2>

<p>Currently, the repository is fairly flat with each volume in its own directory, but no other hierarchy.</p>

<p>Files could be partitioned by "series." A series is a numbered sequence of volumes from a particular court, such as the Massachusetts Reporter of Decisions. The largest series so far contains approximately 1k volumes, 750k pages, and 215k cases, but they are rather inconsistently sized, with the smallest containing only one volume, and the average containing 71. There are 635 series in total.</p>

<p>Many data consumers will want only case files, and not per-page or per-volume files. It may make sense to store case XML files and non-case-XML files in separate repositories.</p>

<h2 id="what-we-need-from-you">What We Need From You</h2>

<p>Ideas. We want to make sure that we get this right the first time. If you have insight into solving problems like this, we'd love to hear from you.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm so insanely happy to be at the <a href="http://www.aec.at/festival/en/">2016 edition of the Ars Electronica Festival</a>. I've wanted to attend for a long time and this year things came together. The festival is as good as I expected.</p>

<p>The scale is large — seemingly endless talks, workshops, and exhibits spread throughout the city of Linz (Austria). I won't attempt any type of comprehensive overview but will share my personal highlights.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/09/IMG_6421-e1473635669196.jpg" alt="IMG_6421" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.interface.ufg.ac.at/christa-laurent/WORKS/artworks/PortraitOnTheFly-Interactive/PortraitOnTheFly.html"><strong>Portrait on the fly</strong></a> by Christa Sommerer and Laurent Mignonneau is an interactive piece — stand in front of it (a monitor with a camera on top) and you see an outline of yourself. You quickly realize the outline is made of buzzing flies. The monitor/camera is surrounded by fantastic printed portraits generated by the installation.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/09/IMG_6504.jpg" alt="IMG_6504" /></p>

<p><strong>Body Pressure</strong> (this is a placeholder name until I track down the correct name) — lay down on a large deflated bag and feel it lift you toward another inflating bag. The two inflated forms come together gently squeezing you between. This piece is beautiful.</p>

<iframe height="700" width="394" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" mozallowfullscreen="" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/182329409?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" webkitallowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.aec.at/radicalatoms/en/face-cartography/">Face Cartography</a></strong> by Daniel Boschung — a robot moves a camera around to 600 different vantage points of a subject's face. The photos are stitched together into a tremendously high resolution photo. The shoot takes 20 minutes to produce one portrait — is this a snapshot?</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We've been working hard on our Private Talking Spaces effort. Lots of thinking about how to create equity in shared spaces in libraries. Lots of thinking about how to increase focus for folks talking on phones (and maintain the focus of those around them not talking on phones). Lots of thinking about where private talking spaces might be located in libraries. So much thinking!!</p>

<p>Much of the labor has been contributed by our collaborator, Nic Schumann, at <a href="http://workshopri.com/">Work-Shop</a>. Part of the Private Talking Spaces team — Anastasia Aizman, Matt Phillips, Ben Steinberg, and Tiff Tseng — visited Nic in Providence this week.</p>

<iframe height="700" width="394" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" mozallowfullscreen="" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/181259019?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" webkitallowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>We started in Work-Shop's building and had the opportunity to see what remained of the recent [Uncommissioned show].(http://uncommissioned.thedesignoffice.org/)</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/09/IMG_5137.jpg" alt="IMG_5137" /></p>

<p>We then played with <a href="http://workshopri.com/projects/the-phone-booth/">Work-Shop's phone booth</a>. Fantastic!!</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/09/IMG_5163.jpg" alt="IMG_5163" /></p>

<p>A quick walk down the street led us to <a href="https://library.risd.edu/">RISD's Fleet Library</a>. I'm still filled with inspiration a day later.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/09/IMG_5144.jpg" alt="IMG_5144" /></p>

<p>So many thoughtful spaces in the Fleet Library including these little study cubbies.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/09/IMG_5217.jpg" alt="IMG_5217" /></p>

<p>We wrapped up the day by taking the scenic route to the train station. ❤️ Providence.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>LIL fellows are wrapping up their terms this week! Please join us for and learn from our Fellows as they present their research involving ways we can explore and utilize technology to preserve, prepare, and present information for the common good.</p>

<p>Over 12 weeks, the Fellows produced everything from book chapters, web applications, and board games ­ and, ultimately, an immeasurable amount of inspiration that extends far beyond the walls of Langdell.  They explored subjects such as text data modeling, web archiving, opening legal data, makerspaces, and preserving local memory in places disrupted by disaster.</p>

<p>Please RSVP to <a href="mailto:gharris@law.harvard.edu">Gail Harris</a></p>

<p>Our fellows will be sharing their work these fascinating topics on <strong>Wednesday, August 24 from 1:00-3:00 in Casperon Room</strong><strong>.</strong></p>

<p>what is the shape of a private talking space in a library? we don't know, but we're thinking hard and talking to a lot of different folks that know how libraries are used</p>

<p>maybe the space ends up being a phone booth from the recent past, or maybe it's a hood that lowers over a carrell, or maybe it's an interstitial passageway with a sound deadening ceiling, or maybe it's simply a heavy curtain that you can pull around you, or maybe it's something else</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/07/lobby.jpg" alt="the team" /></p>

<p>we're collaborating with WorkShop to understand how people want to talk on their phones in libraries. once we gain some understanding, we'll fabricate a solution for the Harvard Law School Library (and beyond!)</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/07/hall.jpg" alt="the team conversing" /></p>

<p>we kicked this effort off a few days ago with a charrette and a tour of the HLSL physical space, Langdell hall</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/07/signs.jpg" alt="phone zone sign" /></p>

<p>please toss an email our way if you know of other folks that have thought about private talking spaces. we'll keep you in the loop as we think, design, and build 💚</p>

<em>A protester throwing cookies at the parliament.</em></p>

<p>Here are some things that caught our ear this fine Thursday at the International Internet Preservation Consortium web archiving conference:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Tom Storrar at the <a href="http://nationalarchives.gov.uk/webarchive/">UK Government Web Archive</a> reports on a user research project: ~20 in person interviews and ~130 <a href="http://www.wammi.com/questionnaire.html">WAMMI</a> surveys resulting in 5 character vignettes. "WAMMI" replaces "WASAPI" as our favorite acronym.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How do we integrate user research into day-to-day development? We'll be chewing more on that one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.jeffersonbailey.com/">Jefferson Bailey</a> shares the Internet Archive's learnings ups and downs with <a href="https://webarchive.jira.com/wiki/display/ARS/Archive-It+Research+Services">Archive-It Research Services</a>. Projects from the last year include <a href="http://www.comparativeagendas.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Gade-and-Wilkerson.pdf">.GOV</a> (100TB of .gov data in a Hadoop cluster donated by <a href="https://www.altiscale.com/">Altiscale</a>), the L3S <a href="http://alexandria-project.eu/">Alexandria Project</a>, and something we didn't catch with Ian Milligan at <a href="http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/Pages/home.aspx">Archives.ca</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You too can learn archive research with Vinay Goel's <a href="https://github.com/vinaygoel/ars-workshop">Archive Research Services Workshop</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>PLUS Jefferson threw in some amazing stuff we still haven't quite figured out involving <a href="https://github.com/vinaygoel/ars-workshop/blob/master/notebooks/WAT-Analysis.ipynb">iPython Notebooks with connections to big data sets</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the WAT? We hear a lot about WATs this year. Common Crawl has a good <a href="http://commoncrawl.org/2014/04/navigating-the-warc-file-format/">explainer</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/ditte-laursen(3ae302d0-3c64-4e72-9227-a7612dd746a8).html">Ditte Laursen</a> sets out to answer a big research question: "What does Danish web look like?" What is the shape of .dk? Eld Zierau reports that in a comparison of the Royal Danish Library's .dk collection with the Internet Archive's collection of Danish-language sites, only something like 10% were in both.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.timelessfuture.com/about/">Hugo Huurdeman</a> asks an important question: what exactly _is _a website? Is it a host, a domain, or a set of pages that share the same CSS? To visualize change in whatever that is, he uses <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ssdeep">ssdeep</a>, a fuzzy hashing mechanism for page comparison.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let's just pause to say how inspiring this all is. It's at about this point in the day that we started totally rethinking a project we've been working on for months.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://twitter.com/justin_littman?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Justin Littman</a> shares the <a href="http://library.gwu.edu/scholarly-technology-group/social-feed-manager">Social Feed Manager</a>, his happenin' stack to harvest tweets and such.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We learned that TWARC is either twerking for WARCs or <a href="http://library.gwu.edu/scholarly-technology-group/social-feed-manager">a Twitter-harvesting Python package</a> – we're not entirely sure. Either way it's our new new favorite acronym. Sorry, WAMMI.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nick Ruest and Ian Milligan give a very cool talk about sifting through hashtagged content on Twitter. Did you know that researchers only have 7-9 days to grab tweets under a hashtag before Twitter only makes the full stream available for a fee? (We did not know that.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were also impressed by Canada's huge amount of political social media engagement. Even though Canada isn't a huge country,[Ian's words not ours] 55,000 Tweets were generated in one day with the #elxn42 tag.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fernando Melo of Arquivo.pt pointed out that the struggle is <em>real</em> with live-web leaks in <a href="https://github.com/Fernando-Melo/WaybackComparison">his research comparing OpenWayback and pywb</a>. Fernando says in his tests OpenWayback was faster but <a href="https://github.com/ikreymer/pywb">pywb</a> has higher-quality playbacks (more successes, fewer leaks). Both tools are expected to improve soon. We say it's time for something like <a href="https://arewefastyet.com/">arewefastyet.com</a> to make this a proper competition.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nicola Bingham is self-deprecating about the British Library's extensive QA efforts: "This talk title isn't quite right because it implies that we have Quality Assurance Practices in the Post Legal Deposit Environment." They use the <a href="http://webcurator.sourceforge.net/">Web Curator Tool QA Module</a>, but are having to go beyond that for domain-scale archiving.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We're also curious about this paper: <a href="http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc333026/m2/1/high_res_d/QA_in_WebArchiving.pdf">Current Quality Assurance Practices in Web Archiving</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://twitter.com/toddstoffer">Todd Stoffer</a> demos NC State's <a href="http://go.ncsu.edu/qa-demo">QA tool</a>. A clever blend of tools like Google Forms, Trello, and IFTTT to let student employees provide archive feedback during downtime. Here are Todd's [snazzy HTML/JS] <a href="http://toddstoffer.github.io/presentation/IIPC-2016/#/">slides</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>TL;DR: lots of exciting things happening in the archiving world. Also exciting: the Icelandic political landscape. On the way to dinner, the team happened upon a <a href="http://icelandreview.com/news/2016/04/05/panama-papers-protest-pictures">relatively small</a> protest right outside of the parliament. There was pot clanging, oil barrel banging, and an interesting use of an active smoke alarm machine as a noise maker. We were also handed "red cards" to wave at the government.</p>

    <p><a href="http://anjackson.net/">Andy Jackson</a> kicks the conference off with "Have I accidentally committed international journalism?" — he has contributed to the open source software that was used to review the Panama Papers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://library.harvard.edu/users/andreagoethals">Andrea Goethals</a> describes the desire for smaller modules in the web archive tool chain, one of her conclusions from Harvard Library's <a href="http://library.harvard.edu/03112016-1203/harvard-library-environmental-scan-web-archiving">Environmental Scan of Web Archiving</a>. This was the first of many calls throughout the day for more nimble tools.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.cdlib.org/contact/staff_directory/sabrams.html">Stephen Abrams</a> shares the California Digital Library's success story with <a href="https://archive-it.org/">Archive-It</a>. "Archive-It is good at what it does, no need for us to replicate that service."</p>

  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/johnerikhalse">John Erik Halse</a> encourages folks to contribute code and documentation. Don't be intimidated and just dive in.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There seems to be consensus that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritrix">Heritrix</a> is a tool that everyone needs but no one is in charge of — that's tough for contributors. A few calls for the Internet Archive to ride in and save the day.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We're not naming names, but a number of organizations have had their IT departments, or IT contractors, seek to run virus scanners that would edit the contents of an archive after preservation. (Hint: it's not easy to archive malware, but "just delete it" isn't the answer.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some kind member of IIPC reminds us of the amazing <a href="https://archive.org/details/malwaremuseum">Malware Museum</a> hosted by the Internet Archive.</p>

  <li>
    <p><a href="http://blog.dshr.org/">David Rosenthal</a> notes that Iceland has been called the <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2010/06/icelands_media_law">"Switzerland of bits"</a>. After being in Reykjavik for only a few days, we sort of agree!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.jeffersonbailey.com/">Jefferson Bailey</a> of the Internet Archive echoed concerns about looming web entropy: there is significant growth in web archiving, but a concentration of storage for archives.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nicholas Taylor of the <a href="http://t.co/mtGnkpTDPY">Stanford Digital Library</a> is responsible for the most wonderful acronym of all time, WASAPI ("Web Archiving Systems API").</p>
  </li>

    <p><a href="https://hjalli.com/">Hjálmar Gíslason</a> points out that 500 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube each minute. It would take 90,000 employees working full time to watch it all. Conclusion: Google needs to hire some people and get on this.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Matt, Jack, and Anastasia are in Reykjavik this week, along with Genève Campbell of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society, for the annual meeting of the International Internet Preservation Consortium. We'll have lots of details from IIPC coming soon, but for this first post we wanted to share some of the things we're noticing here in Reykjavik.</em></p>

<p><strong>[Genève]</strong> Nothing in Reykjavik seems to be empty space. There is always room for something different, new, creative, or odd to fill voids. This is the parking garage of the Harpa concert hall. Traditional fluorescent lamps are interspersed with similar ones in bright colors.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/04/image07.jpg" alt="image07" /></p>

<p><strong>[Jack]</strong> I love how many ways there are to design something as simple as a bathroom. Here are some details I noticed in our guest house:</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/04/iceland-wc.jpg" alt="iceland-wc" /></p>

<p><em>Clockwise from top left: shower set into floor; sweet TP stash as design element; soap on a spike and exposed hot/cold pipes; toilet tank built into wall.</em></p>

<p><strong>[Matt]</strong> Walking around the city is colorful and delightful. Spotting an engaging piece of street art is a regular occurrence. A wonderful, regular occurrence.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/04/image05.jpg" alt="image05" /></p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/04/image03.jpg" alt="image03" /></p>

<p><strong>[Anastasia]</strong> After returning from Iceland for the first time a year ago, I found myself missing something I don't normally give much thought to: Icelandic money is some of the loveliest currency I have ever seen.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/04/image01.jpg" alt="image01" /></p>

<p>The banknotes are quite complex artistically, and yet every denomination abides by thoughtful design principles. Each banknote's side shows either a culturally-significant figure or scene. The denomination is displayed prominently, the typography is ornate but consistent. The colors, beautiful.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/04/20160412_083711.jpg" alt="20160412_083711" /></p>

<p>But what trumps the aesthetics is the banknotes' dimensions. Icelandic paper money is sized according to amount: the 500Kr note is smaller than the 1000Kr note, which in turn is outsized by the 5000Kr note. This is incredibly important — it allows visually impaired people to move about more freely in the world.</p>

<p>In comparison, our money looks silly and our treasury department negligent, as it is impossible to differentiate the values by touch alone. And, confoundingly, there don't seem to be movements to amend this either: in 2015 the department made "strides" by announcing it would start providing money readers, little machines that read value to people who filled out what I'm sure is not a fun amount of paperwork, instead of coming up with a simple design solution.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/04/20160412_0838192.jpg" alt="20160412_083819" /></p>

<p>The coins are a different story. When I first arrived the clunky coins were a happy surprise — they're delightfully weighty (maybe even a little too bulky for normally non-cash-carrying types), adorned with beautifully thoughtful designs. On one side of each of the coins (gold or silver), the denomination stands out in large type along with local sea creatures: a big Lumpfish, three small Capelin fish, a dolphin, a Shore crab.</p>

<p>On the reverse side the four great guardians of Iceland gaze intensely. They are the dragon (<em>Dreki</em>), the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffin&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1460504622399000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEy35QitPr43C8DEijljLn4Uby7Dg">griffin</a> (<em>Gammur</em>), the bull (<em>Griðungur</em>), and the giant (<em>Bergrisi</em>), that each protected Iceland from Denmark invasion in turn, according to the Saga of King Olaf Tryggvason. On the back of the 1 Krona, only the giant stands, commanding.</p>

<p>And that's it. No superfluous information. No humans, either, only mythology and fish.</p>

<p>Returning home is good things, but sometimes it also means re-entering a world where money is just sad green rectangles (and oddly sized coins) full of earthly men.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Adi Kamdar</span> is a 1L at Harvard Law School and our embedded reporter on the Free the Law project. In this first post, he tracks the progress of a casebook through our scanning process from start to finish.</p>
</div>

<p>Harvard Law Library is one of the few collections with nearly every law reporter—roughly 40,000 books in total. The Free the Law project's goal is to put the court decisions inside these volumes online, so anyone can access the precedents that shape the American legal system. Right now, the project is about halfway through, and within the next couple years they'll have completed this monumental task.</p>

<p>But how exactly does a book become a byte? And what happens to these physical texts after they've been digitized?</p>

<h2 id="harvard-depository">Harvard Depository</h2>

<p>The project begins each week with a book order—a 600 book order, to be exact, for law reporters that chronicle U.S. legal history since the country's inception.</p>

<p>The law reporters are held in a sprawling warehouse 30 miles away from the law school—the <a href="http://hul.harvard.edu/hd/pages/facility.html">Harvard Depository</a>. With over 200,000 square feet of storage space, the climate-controlled Depository's mission is <a href="https://vimeo.com/116603551">pure efficiency</a>: each book—and there are over nine million—is sorted and stored by size, rather than by name or author, in order to maximize space.</p>

<p>But it turns out law reporters are the packing peanuts of the Harvard Depository. When the reporters were first sent over to the warehouse, instead of being stored normally, they kept the volumes around in the packaging room. Whenever they filled a cardboard box with other books for storage, they would throw in a reporter or two if there was any extra space that needed to be filled. No one thought the print reporters would be that useful anymore, so making them easily available in bulk was a low priority. Plus, the library had decided to cancel print runs of reporters in 2010, saving valuable shelf space, especially when digital copies were easily available online.</p>

<p>Because of this tactic, law reporters are spread all throughout the Depository. Asking for, say, Michigan's volumes isn't as simple as pulling out a handful of boxes—it's a hunt.</p>

<h2 id="langdell-library">Langdell Library</h2>

<p>Every Wednesday, the team receives the 600 volumes of case reporters. They line the hallway of the ground floor of Langdell, filling shelf after shelf. One by one, each book is examined before it can be taken apart. (Some books—for example, volumes with marginalia—are flagged for archival purposes.) Each volume is then catalogued and given a unique barcode so it can be tracked throughout the whole process.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/o7hwfTX"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/o7hwfTX.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The books are then taken to the Prep Room where, ironically, they're repaired before they're chopped up. Damaged pages are taped together, book bindings are cut off by hand, and the remaining sheets are taken over to a guillotine. Once aligned, the operator has to press two separate buttons underneath the cutting table at the same time to make sure her hands aren't under the blade. The result? Cleanly cut pages.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/ipa45yK"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ipa45yK.jpg" alt="View post on imgur.com" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/9WCsJhP"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/9WCsJhP.jpg" alt="View post on imgur.com" /></a></p>

<p>Next, the bundle of pages is hauled over to the Scanning Room. Here, six employees work overlapping shifts to ensure that pages are being scanned every day, 14 hours a day. Roughly 200 documents per minute are fed through the machine, which has a camera on top and bottom to image both sides of the page.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/OPEdH9y"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/OPEdH9y.jpg" alt="View post on imgur.com" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/2TgT2sr"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/2TgT2sr.jpg" alt="View post on imgur.com" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/COKw2x2"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/COKw2x2.jpg" alt="View post on imgur.com" /></a></p>

<p>Now that the books are chopped and scanned, what happens to the physical pages? After all, the purpose of this project is to digitize the law. Plus, according to circulation records, very few people were reading the old reporters anyway. Rebinding them and keeping them in the library would be a waste of space, time, and money. But just in case anyone questions the authenticity of the scans, Harvard decided it would be valuable to have the physical copies accessible. So the project decided to vacuum seal the pages. Once the pages are jogged together (using a state-of-the-art paper-jogging machine) and placed back inside their book jacket, the volumes are taken over to one last room—where they will be put inside a meat packing device. Yes, it turns out that the meat industry unwittingly stumbled across the best way to preserve books. The machine shrink wraps the pages, maintaining the integrity of the volume while handily adding an extra layer of protection from mold, humidity, and bugs.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/jAXte1p"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/jAXte1p.jpg" alt="View post on imgur.com" /></a></p>

<p>The re-bound volumes are then re-shelved, where they await being shipped off to…</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/NGAgmeU"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/NGAgmeU.jpg" alt="View post on imgur.com" /></a></p>

<h2 id="louisville-kentucky">Louisville, Kentucky</h2>

<p>Because of the Harvard Law Library's limited shelf capacity, the newly packaged pages will soon be loaded onto trucks and shipped down to Louisville.</p>

<p>Why Kentucky? Well, because of <a href="http://www.undergroundvaults.com/about-us/louisville/">Underground Vaults &amp; Storage</a>, a company that has been storing all manner of things in Louisville's old limestone mines. The sealed books will be stored there (where they will "fear no tornado, wildfire, flood or other natural disaster") until the rare instance that they need to be recalled.</p>

<p>And that's the story of these legal volumes—from one massive depository to another, by way of a guillotine, a scanner, and a meat packer. In our next post, we'll explore what happens after they become digital images, and how Free the Law is building the largest free database of legal opinions in the world.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> We are running a two week data mining sprint from January 4–15, 2016, open to current Harvard students, based on early access to a brand new data set of American caselaw. To apply, send a resume and brief statement of interest to jcushman at law dot harvard dot edu.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>We recently announced <a href="/projects/caselaw-access-project/">Free the Law</a>, our project to scan every legal decision ever published in the United States. We're generating the first consistent, comprehensive, and open database of American law, from the colonial era right up to 2015. You can read the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/29/us/harvard-law-library-sacrifices-a-trove-for-the-sake-of-a-free-database.html">New York Times coverage of the project here</a>.</p>

<p>By the end of this project we'll have millions of cases in the dataset — no one knows exactly how many. We're scanning and processing tens of thousands of pages a day, and will soon have entire states completed.</p>

<p>Now it's time to start exploring what to do with all that data. <strong>What new questions can we ask with millions of cases?</strong></p>

<p>The answers cross every discipline at Harvard:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Can a spam filter be retrained to guess which torts cases make the most interesting stories?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How much money are we willing to fight over—and does the answer offer an alternate inflation index?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How has the use of Latin in the law changed over time—are judges writing more or less like regular people?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How have defendants' choice of murder weapon changed? The gender balance of litigants? The reliance on scientific evidence?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can we trace a family's history through the cases they were involved in?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Caselaw is the historical record of applied moral philosophy under the law. Unlocking its secrets will have an incredible impact on scholarship of all kinds.</p>

<h2 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h2>

<p>Hence our challenge: pick a question you think caselaw might help you answer, perhaps drawn from one of your classes. Build a tool to help answer it—whether that means loading up your favorite ML library, configuring an off-the-shelf statistical tool, or writing code from scratch. In a two-week sprint, do your best to answer the question, and to generalize your tool to help other researchers answer similar questions. We'll help share the discoveries you make and the tools you build.</p>

<h2 id="the-data">The Data</h2>

<p>The data set we will share with participants will include a single state's complete published caselaw. The data includes: (1) TIFF and JPEG2000 images for each scanned page; (2) ALTO XML files for each scanned page; and (3) structured XML files for each case.</p>

<h2 id="schedule">Schedule</h2>

<p>December 2015: Application period.</p>

<p>January 4, 2016: Delivery of data set to participants.</p>

<p>January 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 15: The group will check in three times a week, either in person or remotely, to share notes, progress updates, and requests for help.</p>

<p>Week of January 18: demo day (date TBD).</p>

<h2 id="to-apply">To Apply</h2>

<p>Send your resume and brief statement of interest (such as a general idea of what sort of project you would like to work on) to jcushman at law dot harvard dot edu. If you would like to work with others, feel free to apply as a group.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's been almost two years since <a href="/blog/2013/02/12/awesome-boxes-at-somerville-public-library/">Somerville Public Library helped us launch the Awesome Box to public libraries</a> and beyond.</p>

<p>There are now <strong>364 Awesome libraries</strong> around the world.</p>

<p>Over <strong>41,000 items</strong> have been dropped in an Awesome Box in those libraries.
See the items just Awesomed on the <a href="http://awesomebox.io/">Awesome Box page</a>.
Now that the year-end lists have come and gone, we'd like to present the top 110 Awesome items* from the past two years.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This project comes from an amateur, not from the excellent devs here at the Lab. I'm a co-director, not a developer.  If you look at the code (<a href="https://github.com/dweinberger/googleHollis">github</a>) you will have a good laugh. On the other hand, the fact that someone at my level of "skill" can create a semi-workable piece of code is a testament to LibraryCloud's usability. (Also to Paul Deschner's patience with my questions. Thanks, Paul.)</em></p>

<p>Harvard Library has 13M items in its collection. Harvard is digitizing many of them, but as of now you cannot do a full text search of them.</p>

<p>Google Books had 30M books digitized as of a year ago. You can do full-text searches of them.</p>

<p>So, I wrote a <a href="http://hlslwebtest.law.harvard.edu/dev/david/googleHollis/googleHollis.html">little mash-up app</a> [corrected url] that lets you search Google Books for text, and then matches up the results with books in Harvard Library. It's a proof of concept, and I'm counting the concept as proved, or at least as promising. On the other hand, my API key for Google Books only allows 2,000 queries a day, so it's not practical on the licensing front.</p>

<p>This project runs on top of <a href="http://librarycloud.harvard.edu">LibraryCloud</a>. LibraryCloud provides an API to <a href="http://openmetadata.lib.harvard.edu/">Harvard's open library metadata</a> and more. (We're building a new, more scalable version now. It is, well, super-cool.)</p>

<p>Some details below the clickable screenshot…</p>

<p>Click on the image to expand it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/help1.png"><img src="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/help1-273x300.png" alt="googleHollis screen capture" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://hlslibappdev.law.harvard.edu/dev/david/googleHollis/googleHollis.html"><strong>Click here to go to the app</strong></a>.</p>

<p>The Google Books results are on the left (only ten for now), and HOLLIS on the right.</p>

<p>If a Google result is yellow, there's a match with a book in HOLLIS. Gray means no match. HOLLIS book titles are prefaced by a number that refers to the Google results number. Clicking on the Google results number (in the circle) hides or shows those works in the stack on the right; this is because some Google books match lots of items in HOLLIS. (Harvard has a lot of copies of <em>King Lear</em>, for example.)</p>

<p>There are two types of matches. If an item matched on a firm identifier (ISBN,OCLC, LCCN), then there's a checkmark before the title in the HOLLIS stack, and there's a "Stacklife" button in the Google list. Clicking on the Stacklife button displays the book in <a href="http://stacklife.law.harvard.edu/">Harvard StackLife</a>, a very cool—and <a href="http://library.stanford.edu/projects/stanford-prize-innovation-research-libraries-spirl/2014-prizes">prize winning</a>!—library browser created by our Lab. The StackLife stack colorizes items based on how much they're used by the Harvard community. The thickness of the book indicates its page count and its length indicates its actual physical height.</p>

<p>If there's no match on the identifiers, then the page looks for a keyword match on the title and an exact match on the author's last name. This can result in multiple results, not all of which may be right. So, on the Google result there's a "Feeling lucky" button that will take you to the first match's entry in StackLife.</p>

<p>The "Google" button takes you to that item's page at Google Books, filtered by your search terms for your full-texting convenience.</p>

<p>The  "View" button pops up the Google Books viewer for that book, if it's available.</p>

<p>The "Clear stack" button deselects all the items in the Google results, hiding all the items in the HOLLIS stack.</p>

<p>Let me know how this breaks or sucks, but don't expect it ever to be a robust piece of software. Remember its source.</p>

        <title>CURIOSity for collections</title>
        <link>https://lil.law.harvard.edu/blog/2014/03/25/curiosity-for-collections/</link>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><small><em>Edited to incorporate suggestions from Wendy.</em></small></p>

<p><a href="http://library.harvard.edu/users/wendygogel">Wendy Gogel</a> says says a few factors led to this proposal for a new service:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Preservation Services, Academic Technology Services, and Library Technology Services have gotten inquiries about online collection building for faculty, librarians and other staff.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need to replace our aging online collection building tools: Virtual Collections and TED</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We've been creating digital content for 15 years at Harvard, so now have a good foundation for combining and presenting collections in new ways. The new service would be called CURIOSity, and, as Wendy notes, it does not exist yet.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTE: Live-blogging.</strong> Getting things wrong. Missing points. Omitting key information. Introducing artificial choppiness. Over-emphasizing small matters. Paraphrasing badly. Not running a spellpchecker. Mangling other people's ideas and words. You are  <em>warned</em>, people.</p>

<p>The name comes from "cabinets of curiosities" [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_curiosities">Wunderkammern</a>], which were forerunners of modern museums. It also comes from "curios" as treasures.</p>

<p>CURIOSity is designed to enable the creation of web-based collection presentations and exhibits: to make an entire collection accessible through searching and browsing; to highlight a collection (or collections) through an exhibition of a limited number of things; to share a research project; or as a resource for a course.
Features that users expect to see include: searching and browsing; refining results through faceting, descriptive text and thumbnails; narrative context and graphics. Additional desired features might include: geographic display of collections on a map, chronological display on a timeline; or user contributed data like annotations or tags. E.g., Stanford's <a href="http://bassiveratti.stanford.edu/">Bassi-Veratti Collection</a>; <a href="http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/">the Shelley-Godwin Archive</a>; and the <a href="http://www.edickenson.org">Emily Dickinson</a> collection. These are great collections, but they were not easy to create. Wouldn't it help to have services that make it easier? Wendy points to the <a href="https://wiki.harvard.edu/confluence/display/HLSLibraryInteroperability/Collection+and+Exhibition+Platforms">Interoperability wiki</a> where the original notes about the proposal and key requirements are posted.</p>

<p>Based on the discussion at the meeting it is unlikely that a single software solution will solve all the needs, though each requires platform requires different skill sets. The group began by looking at <a href="http://www.Omeka.org">Omeka</a>, <a href="http://www.simile-widgets.org/exhibit3/">Exhibit 3</a>, and <a href="http://projectblacklight.org/">Blacklight</a>. Now they're also looking at <a href="http://www.shared-canvas.org/">Shared Canvas</a>. We can't rely on having resources at hand for doing the required coding and metadata wrangling (converting from native formats). So, maybe we should have a sandbox for experimenting. Then Library Technical Services could provide software hosting.</p>

<p>The CURIOSity program could also evaluate new software packages and provide analyses and feature comparisons.</p>

<p>CURIOSity could provide integration services. It could harvest metadata, link to content in <a href="http://hul.harvard.edu/ois/systems/drs/">DRS</a>, and provide tools and APIs.</p>

<p>Who would do the work? You need programmers and admins to set up the platform. We'd want to customize it to integrate it with Harvard info. E.g., we [the Interoperability Initiative] did a plugin for Omeka so that it can use  distributed sources.  Each collection needs to be customized. We could create designs specific to a department. For each collection, a curator has to manage the content, rights clearances, etc. There's a lot of work, and this would take more than LTS!</p>

<h2 id="qa-and-discussion">Q&amp;A; and Discussion</h2>

<p>Q: A lot of it is about design. That's half of how we spend our time.</p>

<p>Q: Aesthetics are expensive and change.</p>

<p>Q: How long do we expect these collections to live?</p>

<p>Q: There needs to be an easy way to get your metadata out.</p>

<p>Q: The metadata should be sustainable.</p>

<p>Q: What would be the first collection building software to support?</p>

<p>A: Probably Omeka, and we're looking at the <a href="http://library.stanford.edu/blogs/digital-library-blog/2014/02/stanford-begins-development-spotlight">Spotlight</a> plugin for Blacklight that makes it easier to use.</p>

<p>When we arrived at the exhibit hall it was a dash to get our booth setup. We tossed on the tablecloths, hung up our signage, and set up our sample books and boxes. We grabbed lunch and then began honing our carney-style Awesome Box pitch for the steady stream of library folk.</p>

<p>We pitched and pitched and pitched for two and half days. What a great way to get the selling points nailed down.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2014/03/carney.jpg" alt="carney" /></p>

<p>So many enthusiastic librarians, especially from Indiana, and so many helpful friends (Craig from <a href="http://www.cambridgema.gov/cpl.aspx">Cambridge Public Library</a>, Maura from <a href="http://www.imls.gov/">IMLS</a>, and Tim from <a href="https://www.librarything.com/">LibraryThing</a>).

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've posted a <a href="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/DanCohenFCC.mp3">podcast interview with Dan Cohen</a>, the executive director of the <a href="http://dp.la">Digital Public Library of America</a> about <a href="http://dp.la/info/2013/09/26/dpla-fcc-erate-upgrade/">their proposal to the FCC</a>.</p>

<p>The FCC is looking for ways to modernize the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Rate">E-Rate</a> program that has brought the Internet to libraries and schools. The DPLA is proposing <em>DPLA Local</em>, which will enable libraries to create online digital collections using the DPLA's platform.</p>

<p>I'm excited about this for two reasons beyond the service it would provide.</p>

<p>First, it could be a first step toward providing cloud-based library services, instead of the  proprietary, closed, expensive systems libraries typically use to manage their data. (<a href="evergreen-ils.org/">Evergreen</a>, I'm not talking about you, you open source scamp!)</p>

<p>Second, as libraries build their collections using DPLA Local, their metadata is likely to assume normalized forms, which means that we should get cross-collection discovery and semantic riches.</p>

<p>Here's the <a href="http://dp.la/info/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/E-rate_Comment_DPLA.pdf">proposal itself</a>. And here's where <a href="http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs/">you can comment to the FCC</a> about it.</p>

We can tell ourselves, "Hey, don't worry about it. There are at least 542 million other cat pictures out there. I'll find another one." Sometimes though, you are linking to something important and it's a huge bummer to lose the content at the other end of the link. Like when you're <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2329161">reading a Supreme Court opinion and every other link you click on is dead</a>.</p>

<p>The problem of missing linked content, or reference rot, is solvable though and we've taken a stab at it. Our solution is <a href="http://perma.cc">Perma.cc</a>.</p>

<p>At Perma.cc, any author (you!) can input a URL for archiving. When you submit the URL to Perma.cc, Perma.cc will, in realtime, download the content at that URL and pass back to you a new URL (a "Perma.cc link"). You can then insert the new link into your scholarly paper, blog entry, or Supreme Court opinion. For example, if you're referencing the Dole Kemp '96 campaign site, you'll give Perma.cc, <a href="http://dolekemp96.org">dolekemp96.org</a>, and Perma.cc will return <a href="http://perma.cc/0M9BDKrtCL6">http://perma.cc/0M9BDKrtCL6</a> to  you for insertion into your publication.</p>

<p>Perma.cc is a big effort and we knew we'd be in over our heads if we tried to go it alone. So, we found some friends—<a href="http://perma.cc/about">30 or so amazing partners</a> that are helping us build the product and host the archived sites.</p>

<p>Libraries are ideal partners for Perma.cc. They are uniquely situated to battle reference rot—they're trusted sources, they're good at archiving, and they think on a long timescale.</p>

<p>This effort has been getting some coverage lately. Get started with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/24/us/politics/in-supreme-court-opinions-clicks-that-lead-nowhere.html">the New York Times piece</a> and give <a href="http://www.marketplace.org/shows/marketplace-tech-report/marketplace-tech-tuesday-september-24-2013">Jonathan Zittrain's Marketplace Tech interview a listen</a>.</p>

<p>As with all of the Lab's work, our code is open and we'd love to have your help. So, mosey on over to <a href="https://github.com/harvard-lil/perma">GitHub</a>, fork the repo, fix and enhance, and send us pull requests. Thank you.</p>

<p>This March, Sidsel Bech-Petersen a Library Transformer at <a href="https://www.aakb.dk/in-english">Aarhus Public Libraries</a> and I have proposed a session at South By Southwest Interactive.  It's called <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/19336">Library Machines</a>, and essentially, it's a discussion/workshop to explore new ideas and directions for libraries.  It will be the spiritual sibling of last year's <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/2696">Libraries: the Ultimate Playground</a>.</p>

<p>During the Library Machines session, we'll all go through a quick, <a href="http://librarytestkitchen.org/assets/Librarian-Created-Machines.pdf">"mad libs" style design exercise</a>, and use that as a jumping off point for a larger discussion through the rest of the session.</p>

<p>1) If you're going to be at SXSW, join us! this will be a discussion and making session, not a presentation</p>

<p>2) If all goes according to plan, outside this session we should be facilitating a bunch of library "innovation"-y fun stuff so reach out if you're interested in helping!  (jgoldenson AT law.harvard.edu)</p>

<p><a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/19336">Give it a thumbs up, a tweet and if inspired, make an Library Machine in the comments!  </a></p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday and Thursday I went to the second <a href="http://www.lodlam.net">LODLAM</a> (linked open data for libraries, archives, and museums) unconference, in Montreal. I'd attended the first one in San Francisco two years ago, and this one was almost as exciting—"almost" because the first one had more of a new car smell to it. This is a sign of progress and by no means is a complaint. It's a great conference.</p>

<p>But, because it was an unconference with up to eight simultaneous sessions, there was no possibility of any single human being getting a full overview. Instead, here are some overall impressions based upon my particular path through the event.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Serious progress is being made. E.g., Cornell announced it will be switching to a full LOD library implementation in the Fall. There are lots of great projects and initiatives already underway.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some very competent tools have been developed for converting to LOD and for managing LOD implementations. The development of tools is obviously crucial.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There isn't obvious agreement about the standard ways of doing most things. There's innovation, re-invention, and lots of lively discussion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the most interesting and controversial discussions were about whether libraries are being too library-centric and not web-centric enough. I find this hugely complex and don't pretend to understand all the issues. (Also, I find myself—perhaps unreasonably—flashing back to the Standards Wars in the late 1980s.) Anyway, the argument crystallized to some degree around <a href="http://bibframe.org">BIBFRAME</a>, the Library of Congress' initiative to replace and surpass <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MARC_standards">MARC</a>. The criticism raised in a couple of sessions was that Bibframe (I find the all caps to be too shouty) represents how libraries think about data, and not how the Web thinks, so that if Bibframe gets the bib data right for libraries, Web apps may have trouble making sense of it. For example, Bibframe is creating its own vocabulary for talking about properties that other Web standards already have names for. The argument is that if you want Bibframe to make bib data widely available, it should use those other vocabularies (or, more precisely, namespaces). Kevin Ford, who leads the Bibframe initiative, responds that you can always map other vocabs onto Bibframe's, and while Richard Wallis of OCLC is enthusiastic about the very webby <a href="http://schema.org">Schema.org</a> vocabulary for bib data, he believes that Bibframe definitely has a place in the ecosystem. Corey Harper and Debra Riley-Huff, on the other hand, gave strong voice to the cultural differences. (If you want to delve into the mapping question, explore the argument about whether Bibframe's annotation framework maps to Open Annotation.)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I should add that although there were some strong disagreements about this at LODLAM, the participants seem to be genuinely respectful.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>LOD remains really really hard. It is not a natural way of thinking about things. Of course, neither are old-fashioned database schemas, but schemas map better to a familiar forms-based view of the world: you fill in a form and you get a record. Linked data doesn't even think in terms of records. Even with the new generation of tools, linked data is hard.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>LOD is the future for library, archive, and museum data.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Susanne Dorson came in the LABRARY with her family.</p>

<p>Son pictured here:</p>

<div class="embed-container"><iframe width="320" height="240" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/67584944" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

<p>We got to talking and she told me about the amazing shop she co-founded just down the road in Arlington called <a href="http://www.littlefoxshop.com/">The Little Fox Children's Resale Shop</a>, aka The Little Fox Shop.  So Annie and I finally took a field trip.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.librarytestkitchen.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/1.jpg" alt="" />]</p>

<p><img src="http://www.librarytestkitchen.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/9.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="http://www.librarytestkitchen.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>They've really got an amazing thing going there, a bulleted list of things we learned.</strong></p>

<p>The space:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The space is attached to the Edith Fox Library in Arlington, MA.</li>
  <li>The room was never used by the library however, it previously housed the town depts., so it's not taking up library space</li>
  <li>It's large (stroller friendly is key they've learned)</li>
  <li>A Professional look and display is important to sales</li>
</ul>

<p>It's a symbiotic relationship, all money goes to the library.  The impact is amazing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>keeps the library open on Friday, one extra day each week</li>
  <li>a new paint job for the library</li>
  <li>new blinds</li>
  <li>computer tables</li>
  <li>non-fiction kids books, among other collections purchases made by…</li>
  <li>bean bag chairs</li>
  <li>furniture re-upholstery</li>
  <li>sing-alongs</li>
  <li>signage</li>
</ul>

<p>Beyond bringing in money, Little Fox Shop relies entirely on volunteers for operations, a unique community building opportunity:</p>

<ul>
  <li>expecting-mother volunteers meet new mothers (while also learning about the who world of baby clothes and gear)</li>
  <li>volunteer parents can bring kids along while they work</li>
  <li>senior citizens stay connected to folks of all ages, and vice versa— intergenerational</li>
</ul>

<p>From the moment I heard about LFS, it's stuck with me.  It's such a complementary use of space with a library.  Parents come in for a lapsit or sing along, afterwards they wander into the Fox Shop where children can play with toys while they can shop or just hang out and play too.</p>

<p>It's an interesting thing when libraries, or services in them, begin to sell things. Is this erosion?  Some uses of space seem less so.  A coffee shop can be a natural fit.  Children's resale shops feel like a fit too.  Perhaps the second hand nature, the grassroots beginnings, the kid's orientation, plus the free-to-play policy feels sufficiently gentle.  I don't feel like the Edith Fox Branch "sold out" or something.</p>

<p>As Susanne pointed out, for libraries faced with closure or dramatic reduction in programming and hours, an entrepreneurial approach to problem-solving doesn't hurt.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>(crossposted from <a href="http://www.librarytestkitchen.org/">librarytestkitchen.org</a>)</em></p>

<p>I love the whole relevance by adjacency logic that libraries rely on. Similar things are next to each other. But libraries only do this with books. Can't we do it with more media types?</p>

<p><em>Media Wall: A gestalt, walk-by browsing experience. No headphones required</em>.</p>

<div class="embed-container"><iframe width="320" height="240" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/66917442" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

<p>I've been curious about this idea of a Media Wall for a while. A walk-along stack interlacing the "push" of motion media with the more "pull" required of print media. Then, couple weeks back, I was at a friend's place, and he basically had the arrangement already in place (plus toy storage for his sons).</p>

<p>Here's the professional sound dome technology:</p>

<div class="embed-container"><iframe width="320" height="240" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/55813220?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/55813220">Single Localizer Sound Dome Demonstration Video</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user4231831">Brown Innovations, Inc.</a></p>

<p>You can also imagine handing over this audio/video/shelf space infrastructure to an artist or class and see it used in unexpected ways.</p>

<p>This past weekend I went through two iterations. I first got a rough protoype going in the basement. I used one of the old LABRARY lamps from Ikea.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.librarytestkitchen.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/v1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Then got a second version (using different speaker) working on a bookshelf. Plus tried to lay down some yoga mats for acoustic dampening.</p>

<p>All in all, the sound domes I created worked poorly at best. It seems brown innovations is doing more than throwing a speaker in a salad bowl.</p>

<p>Here's a bit of science fiction. I improved my sound dome's sound localization performance in post. It doesn't work this well. But further illustrates effect.</p>

<div class="embed-container"><iframe width="320" height="240" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/67152819" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

<p>Next steps?</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I received an overdue notice a little while back.  I've received them many times.  But I looked at it and I realized it was pretty complicated.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2013/04/overdue-existing.jpg" alt="overdue-existing" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Did I really need to know the Barcode number?</li>
  <li>The date and time I originally took it out.</li>
  <li>Why was the title so buried?</li>
  <li>etc…</li>
</ul>

<p>So here's just an idea, implementing such a thing into our ILS would be difficult and demand sign-off all the way up the food chain.</p>

<p>But what if it could be simple HTML?</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2013/04/over-due-improved.jpg" alt="over-due-improved" /></p>

<p>Maybe we could add a 1-click renew button.  Or, maybe a courtesy auto-renew.  Perhaps in the future we could add opt-in events listings or book recommendations, etc.</p>

<p>Overdue notices are the primary correspondence between the library and its community.  We should give them their due attention.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week we launched what we think is a useful and appealing way to browse books at scale, timed to coincide with the launch of the <a href="http://dp.la">Digital Public Library of America</a>. (Congrats, DPLA!!!)</p>

<p><a href="http://stacklife-dpla.law.harvard.edu">StackLife DPLA</a> (a  version of what we use to call ShelfLife) shows you a visualization of books on a scrollable shelf, which we turn sideways so you can read the spines. It always shows you books in a context, on the grounds that no book stands alone. You can shift the context instantly, so that you can (for example) see a work on a shelf with all the other books classified under any of the categories professional cataloguers have assigned to it.</p>

<p>We also heatmap the books according to various usage metrics ("StackScore"), so you can get a sense of the work's community relevance.</p>

<p>There are lots more features, and lots more to come.</p>

<p>StackLife DPLA is an intersecting set of functionality with StackLife Harvard we'll be releasing the Harvard version this week. The DPLA version mashes up the books in the Digital Public Library of America's collection (from the <a href="http://http//www.biodiversitylibrary.org/">Biodiversity Heritage Library</a>) with books from The <a href="http://www.archive.org/">Internet Archive</a>‘s <a href="http://demo.openlibrary.org/">Open Library</a> and the <a href="http://www.hathitrust.org">Hathi Trust</a>. These are all online, accessible books, so you can just click and read them. There are 1.7M in the StackLife DPLA metacollection. (Development was funded in part by a Sprint grant from the DPLA. Thank you, DPLA!)</p>

<p>Here are some links:</p>

<p>StackLife DPLA: <a href="http://stacklife-dpla.law.harvard.edu">http://stacklife-dpla.law.harvard.edu</a>
The DPLA press release: <a href="http://library.harvard.edu/stacklife-browse-read-digital">http://library.harvard.edu/stacklife-browse-read-digital</a>
The DPLA version FAQ: <a href="http://stacklife-dpla.law.harvard.edu/#faq/">http://stacklife-dpla.law.harvard.edu/#faq/</a></p>

<p>The StackLife team—along with the fabulous <a href="http://imakewebthings.com/">Caleb Troughton</a>—has worked long and hard on this. We're pretty durn proud. And we're very excited about the launch of the DPLA, too!</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[<a href="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/dev/david/podcasts/AndrewOdlyzko-Feb8-2013.mp3">mp3 here</a>]</p>

<p>Last week, <a href="http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/">Andrew Odlyzko</a> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Odlyzko">wikipedia</a>] a mathematician and historian, and former head of the University of Minnesota's Digital Technology Center, posted a <a href="http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/libpubcomp.pdf">research paper</a> that concludes that the data suggest that libraries are losing their competition with the publishers of academic journals. Andrew is a long-time open access advocate, so he's not saying this is a good thing. But he is a data-driven historian.</p>

<p>So I gave him a call, and we talked for about 25 minutes about the paper, and more generally about the role of curators in an age of free or cheap abundance. You can listen <a href="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/dev/david/podcasts/AndrewOdlyzko-Feb8-2013.mp3">here</a>.</p>

<p>Here's Andrew's abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Discussions of the economics of scholarly communication are usually devoted to Open Access, rising journal prices, publisher profits, and boycotts.  That ignores what seems a much more important development in this market.  Publishers, through the oft-reviled  "Big Deal" packages, are providing much greater and more egalitarian access to the journal literature, an approximation to true Open Access.  In the process they're also marginalizing libraries, and obtaining a greater share of the resources going into scholarly communication.  This is enabling a continuation of publisher profits as well as of what for decades has been called "unsustainable journal price escalation."  It is also inhibiting the spread of Open Access, and potentially leading to an oligopoly of publishers controlling distribution through large-scale licensing.</p>

  <p>The "Big Deal" practices are worth studying for several general reasons.  The degree to which publishers succeed in diminishing the role of libraries may be an indicator of the degree and speed at which universities transform themselves.  More importantly, these "Big Deals" appear to point the way to the future of the whole economy, where progress is characterized by declining privacy, increasing price discrimination, increasing opaqueness in pricing, increasing reliance on low-paid or unpaid work of others for profits, and  business models that depend on customer inertia.</p>

        <title>Boxes deployed, more data</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We recently rolled out more Awesome Boxes here at Harvard. We now have boxes in Widener, Langdell, Lamont, and Cabot.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2012/12/ab-locattion-wild-arrows.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>We have a couple of other boxes waiting to be delivered to their new homes after the new year.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2012/12/many-ab-lower-thin.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We put together a special box for our home base, Langdell Library here in the Law School.</p>

<div class="embed-container"><iframe width="320" height="240" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/55814585" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

<p>It's an Arduino equipped box. A small photoresistor in the floor of the box detects light change. When the change is 35% greater or smaller than the last time it took a reading, it sends power to three LEDs tucked in a piece of plexiglass in the sign.</p>

<p>The physical boxes have been fun to build and share, but it's important to keep in mind that they're a minor part of the Awesome Box project. The Awesome Box project is concerned with allowing members of the community to share what they found awesome. You don't need a flashing box to do that. A no-tech solution works just as well and maybe better: Use masking tape to partition an area on the returns desk. When something is placed there, put it on a featured shelf.</p>

<p>We've seen an uptick in awesomeing after we rolled out the additional boxes. We went from about ten items a week to five to ten per day. (These numbers are rough and the sample size is tiny – don't put much stock in them.) So, more boxes yields better community penetration yields results. If you want to have a look at these results, pop over to <a href="http://hrvd.me/awesomebox">http://hrvd.me/awesomebox</a> and follow the <a href="http://twitter.com/hlawesome">Twitter stream</a>.</p>

<p>If you want an Awesome Box for your library, we'd love to hear from you. <a href="mailto:lil@law.harvard.edu">Email us</a>.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On off moments over this summer, Annie and I have put together our new site.  You know, splashed some water on our face.</p>

<p>That's what you're looking at.  LiL, freshened up.</p>

<p>The goals:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Freshen up our look</li>
  <li>Mobile-friendly</li>
  <li>Make it really easy to add stuff, but no big-time CMS nonsense</li>
  <li>Fun</li>
  <li>Shareable</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>1)</strong> We'd built the original site about two years ago—a long time in internet time.  It worked, but it was a bit heavy and very fixed.  We wanted to lighten up things a bit.  Annie ended up on <a href="http://2x4.org/">2x4's website</a> and that started everything off.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2012/08/2x4.png" alt="" />As you'll no doubt see, our homepage is HEAVILY inspired by 2x4's work.  Ours is less refined, but gets at the general idea of a long pane of scattershot (but underlying grid adhering) images.</p>

<p><strong>2)</strong> By now, a lot of the web has been <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrapped</a>—folks everywhere have built their websites using Twitter's recently open source web framework, Bootstrap.  There are a lot of reasons for this, but the primary one is packaging.  They've thrown in nice buttons, cross-browser fixes, and a good responsive grid to make your site work on mobile.  The elegant mobile handling is really why we started on this framework.</p>

<p><strong>3)</strong> We wanted the site to be able to change a lot.  And frequently.  At the same time, neither of us wanted to muck around in the CMS worlds of drupal, etc. It's just too complicated.  So we took the wordpress-as-CMS route.  Each project gets its own wordpress "page" that we link to.  Easy to update, manage, etc. We restyled a great, free wordpress theme called <a href="http://320press.com/wpbs/">WordPress Bootstrap</a> by <a href="http://320press.com/">320 Press</a> to make the blog look a lot like every other page.  That way a blog page (which is easy to author) can double as a project page and look pretty natural (nice hack Paul!).</p>

<p>Even cooler, Annie came up with a clever system to add all content—people, projects, etc.—info into one, easy-to-understand file (we've called it ingredients.json).   And then those assets ripple through all the pages.  She'll go into it in another post.</p>

<p><strong>4)</strong> Everybody seemed to like the mouse-over about us page from our last site.  So we took that and ran with it.  Some, not all, images come to life with a hover.  And some more than others—Jessica's been dabbling in animating some .gif's.  The hover state is not one that ports to mobile.  Any ideas port the fun to these devices?</p>

<p><strong>5)</strong> I'd say this is the big point, <em><a href="https://github.com/harvard-lil/website">we wanted to give our site away</a></em>.  Take it. Run with it.  Modify it. Whatever. I got obsessed with the idea of sharing sites whole hog.  The site meets our needs as a lightweight wordpress CMS.  Wordpress was complicated enough. Maybe you find yourself in that position—or just want a pretty simple site that makes hovering things fun. <a href="https://github.com/harvard-lil/website"> It's on github</a>.  It ain't all polished and buffed under the hood, and lot's more documentation to come, but our site's out. Make it your site, or improve it so we can add your changes to our site.</p>

<p>The site will take on more and more of its own character over time, but we've rebooted.  And it seems like it's time.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Berkman  Center's <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/dobrien">David O'Brien</a>, <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/ugasser/">Urs Gasser</a>, and <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/palfrey/">John Palfrey</a> have just posted a 29-page "<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2111396">briefing paper</a>" on the various models and licenses by which libraries are providing access to e-books.</p>

<p>It's not just facts 'n' stats by any means, but here are some anyway:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to the 2011 Library Journal E-Book Survey, 82% of libraries currently offer access to e-books, which reflects an increase of 10 percentage points from 2010. … Libraries maintain an average of 4,350 e-book copies in a collection.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>[T]he publisher-to-library market across all formats and all libraries (e.g., private, public, governmental, academic, research, etc.) is approximately $1.9B; of this, the market for public libraries is approximately $850M</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>92% of libraries use OverDrive as their  e-book dealer</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Of the major publishers, only Random House allows unrestricted lending of e-books.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I found the section on business models to be particularly clarifying.</p>

<p>We've been loving github lately. We used to manage our own Git repositories on a local development server, then we saw the glowing beacon that is github. We ran to it and we haven't looked back.</p>

<p>Code management is as good as it gets. Project management is pleasant too thanks to <a href="https://github.com/blog/831-issues-2-0-the-next-generation">github issues.</a></p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2012/07/github-snap-e1343077331810.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Please have a look around <a href="https://github.com/organizations/harvard-lil">our home on github, http://github.com/harvard-lil</a>. And don't just look, hop in: fork projects you're interested in -&gt; fix bugs and make enhancements -&gt; send us pull requests</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Who are you, and what do you do?</strong></p>

]]></description>
        
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Who are you, and what do you do?</strong></p>

<p>I'm Annie Cain.  I was once a librarian and maybe still am.  Either way, I currently build web apps.  For libraries.  I also come up with ideas, help shape ideas and help execute &amp; build non-web ideas.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2012/07/DSC_33592.jpg" alt="Setup Annie Cain" /></p>

<p><strong>What hardware do you use?</strong></p>

<p>My work machine is a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macpro/">giant Mac Pro</a>.  Sometimes I bump my knee on it.  A big-enough Acer monitor is connected to it.  I use a <a href="http://www.apple.com/magicmouse/">Magic Mouse</a> because the cord was cramping my style.  My folding <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-PX-100-Lightweight-Collapsible/dp/B000089GN3">Sennheiser headphones</a> are not audiophile approved, but they suit me just fine.</p>

<p>At home I have a MacBook Air.  I think I'm the only one in the world who despises the MacBook Air.</p>

<p>When I go to meetings, I generally bring a <a href="http://rhodiapads.com/">Rhodia notebook</a> and <a href="http://www.zebrapen.com/products/pen/f-301?c=30">Zebra pen</a> along.  More often than not I also have a snack and the <a href="http://www.tealuxe.com/component/page,shop.product_details/flypage,tealuxe-hg-flypage.tpl/product_id,606/category_id,24/option,com_virtuemart/Itemid,1/">cheapest clear mug I cound find in Harvard Square</a>, filled with water or tea.  I live in fear that Republic of Tea will stop selling their <a href="http://www.republicoftea.com/passionfruit-papaya-black/p/V00589/">Passion Fruit Papaya blend</a>.</p>

<p>Sometimes I use my window as a refrigerator.  I can fit a sandwich between the two panes of glass.</p>

<p><strong>And what software?</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.charcoaldesign.co.uk/magical">MagiCal</a> is the first thing I install on a new Mac.</p>

<p>I constantly use <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2503">Exposé</a> to find buried windows and access the desktop.</p>

<p>When working directly on the development server (which is all the time, scandalous!), I type code in <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/">BBEdit</a> and push images up with <a href="http://panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a>.  When I'm not feeling up to typing SQL in the Terminal (which is most of the time, scandalous!), I use <a href="http://www.sequelpro.com/">Sequel Pro</a> to interact with MySQL.</p>

<p>I use Firefox when web developing.  Firebug provides most of what I need to understand what's going on.  <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/measureit/">MeasureIt</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/jsonview/">JSONView</a> also help.  Heck, I still use some features of the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-developer/">Web Developer extension</a>.  For my general browsing and <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/">Google Reader</a> perusing, I use Chrome.  I go to <a href="http://byliner.com/">Byliner</a> if I need a longer reading break.</p>

<p>Photoshop is the only one of the Suite that I know how to operate, so it's the hammer for all of my graphics nails.</p>

<p>We're not afraid to share our stuff on <a href="https://github.com/harvard-lil">GitHub</a>.  It's also super handy for collaboration and tracking code &amp; issues.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2012/07/IMG_1995.jpg" alt="Setup Annie Desk" /></p>

<p><strong>What would be your dream setup?</strong></p>

<p>Better lighting would probably get me a lot closer to a dream setup.  Ideally I'd work on a laptop.  Maybe connect it to a bigger monitor sometimes.  It would definitely have an SD card slot.</p>

<p>A refrigerator would be nice as my window doesn't stay cool in the summer.  A mug warmer to keep my tea steamy would also be super.</p>

<p><strong>Who are you, and what do you do?</strong></p>

<p>I'm Jessica. I just finished up the urban planning masters program over at the <a href="http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/">GSD</a>. I'm hanging out at the lab for the summer, working primarily on<a href="/blog/2012/06/14/timeslice/"> Time/Slice</a>, a project I started in the <a href="http://librarytestkitchen.org/">Library Test Kitchen</a>. The Lab is very awesome.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>What hardware do you use?</strong></p>

<p>My most important hardware is my pen, which is a rotring extra-fine fountain pen. It was originally quite long; I had one break in my pocket so I sawed off the end and duct taped it. Now it fits in my pocket much better. My other piece of important hardware is a binder clip, which holds together a lot of printer paper full of my calendar, lists, notes, etc.</p>

<p>I rely on my MacBook Pro (4,1) for most things. It has a vintage 2008 battery that generates excessive heat, which can be nice in the winter. I also have an i5 iMac that I use for heavier stuff (a lot of GIS). My phone is a Nokia 6315i. The antenna broke off (also a pocket-related accident), so it is super svelte now. I have a Kindle Touch that I like a lot more than I expected to.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2012/07/photo-15.jpg" alt="my pen writes well" /></p>

<p><strong>What software do you use?</strong></p>

<p>A lot of Adobe Creative Suite, mostly Illustrator, for design. Other than that, I like free things. For mapping I do use ArcGIS, but I've gotten really into <a href="http://mapbox.com/tilemill/">TileMill</a> recently. It makes maps that are nice and pretty. I use <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/TextWrangler/">TextWrangler</a> for coding, and <a href="http://www.bean-osx.com/Bean.html">Bean</a> for typing words. When I really really need to write something, <a href="http://www.ommwriter.com/">ommwriter</a> is helpful.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> makes using my computer a lot more enjoyable, as does  <a href="http://stereopsis.com/flux/">f.lux</a> and <a href="http://jumpcut.sourceforge.net/">jumpcut</a>. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> helps me to not lose all my important things. I use <a href="http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/index.php">GeekTool</a> for keeping important information on my desktop, such as the weather and my new year's resolutions. My computer counts <a href="http://www.electricsheep.org/">electric sheep</a> when it sleeps.</p>

<p>I go back and forth between Chrome and Firefox, but with both I love <a href="https://chrometabcloud.appspot.com/">TabCloud</a> and and <a href="http://fivefilters.org/kindle-it/">being able to send articles straight to my Kindle</a>.</p>

<p><strong>What would be your dream setup?</strong></p>

<p>My dream setup would be a fort that could also get lots of sunlight. It would also have a little stop-motion animation setup ready to go at all times. It might be in a tree.</p>

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/45073647">office</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user7144664">Harvard Library Innovation Lab</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Who are you, and what do you do?</strong></p>

<p>Hi, my name's Jeff.  I do design and new ideas here at the Lab.  The Lab ROCKS! It's a great job.  Sometimes I help make websites (like this one), sometimes I do <a href="http://www.librarytestkitchen.org/">classes</a> and right now, even working on some <a href="http://librarylicense.org/">policy-ish stuff</a> with folks from here and the <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/">Berkman Center</a>.</p>

<p><strong>What hardware do you use?</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2012/07/crib.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I have a mac tower that is cool.  I have 2 monitors, that's good.  I also have a Mac Mighty Mouse</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2012/07/mighty-Mouse2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I like the wheel, but gunk does get stuck in it so it requires maintenance.  I'd say the hardware I'm passionate about is the <a href="http://www.gradolabs.com/page_headphones.php?item=f4ba8830232696b5f580bd531134b668">Grado SR60 Headphones</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2012/07/sonicPrivacy.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now those things actually rock. For those with immediate officemates or a quiet atmosphere they are quite acoustically transparent. The other piece of noise control technology I like is earplugs.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2012/07/noise-cancelling.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Both of these tools allow me to better get lost in thought…  I've been using earplugs since college, so at this point it's practically associative:  Ear Plugs in = (More) Focus</p>

<p>I also drink coffee out of a jar because I can put it in my bag, SEAL IT, and confidently ride to work without it spilling.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2012/07/coffee-in-a-jar.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>And that brings me to that ruler in the background.  I like the ruler, it has so many uses.</p>

<div class="embed-container"><iframe width="320" height="240" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/45073425" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/45073425">web site width</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user7144664">Harvard Library Innovation Lab</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

<p><strong>What software do you use?</strong></p>

<p>Adobe Creative Suite, BBEdit, FileZilla, Outlook cause of Harvard U. buy-in, and Spotify.</p>

<p><strong>What would be your dream setup</strong></p>

<p>I'm curious about that inkling thing.  Maybe waiting for version two.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2012/07/Screen-shot-2012-07-02-at-12.44.10-PM.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Well.  Now that I think about it, this would be my dream setup</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We're regular readers of <a href="http://usesthis.com/">The Setup</a>. We really like it. We like it so much that we're doing a local version for the Lab. Matt is up first.</p>

<p><strong>Who are you, and what do you do?</strong></p>

<p>I'm Matt Phillips.</p>

<p>I work in the Harvard Library Innovation Lab. I try to make libraries better, usually by writing software.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2012/06/DSC_3349-e1340592772849.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>What hardware do you use?</strong></p>

<p>While at the Lab, most of my work happens on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_iMac">i3, 21.5" iMac</a>. I have a second <a href="http://us.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/group/monitors">24" Acer monitor</a> sitting next to it. I use an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Mouse">Apple Magic Mouse</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Keyboard#Apple_Pro_Keyboard_.28M7803.29">109 key Apple keyboard</a>. Pretty vanilla.</p>

<p>When I'm not in the office I use an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macbook_pro">i5, 15" Mac Book Pro</a>. I love this machine.</p>

<p>We have a few <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_PowerEdge">Dell PowerEdge machines</a> sitting in a closet upstairs we use for testing, data crunching, and to serve up our public site. We also have a couple of <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2 instances</a> we use for <a href="http://news.librarycloud.org/">Library News</a> and a skunkworks project.</p>

<p>That's the bigger hardware.</p>

<p>My head spends about a third of its day wrapped in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-HD515-Dynamic-Audiophile-Headphones/dp/B0001FTVDG">Sennheiser HD 515 headphones</a>.</p>

<p>I occasionally break out of the digital world and scratch things out on paper. This usually happens when I'm trying to architect a piece of system or I'm working through some tough logic. I've found that I really like strips of paper for drawing out ideas. 8.5" x 11" pieces cut lengthwise are perfect.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollerball_pen">Rollerball pens</a> are my go to.</p>

<p>Paper also enters my workspace when I'm proofing a draft of a blog entry or something that I think might reach more than a handful friendly people. Paper and pen are so easy to use. They require very little cognitive overhead. They let you focus on the content and not the tools.</p>

<p>I have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad">first generation iPad</a> and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle">third generation Kindle</a>, but I rarely use them. If I want to do computer stuff, I use my laptop. If I want to read a book, I'm generally on paper. I'm not a paper fetishist, it's just that my library generally lends me non-digital items.</p>

<p>My <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_4S">iPhone 4s</a> gets regular use during the day. I use it for music and for quick pictures and videos.</p>

<p><strong>And what software?</strong></p>

<p>Most of my day is spent in <a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/">OS X</a>. When I'm working on one of our servers, I'm in <a href="http://www.centos.org/">CentOS</a>, some <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">Redhat</a> somethignororther, or <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>.</p>

<p>I rely heavily on <a href="https://github.com/quicksilver/quicksilver">Quicksilver</a> for application launching.</p>

<p>I have a whole bunch of different user accounts and API keys. I use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keychain_(Mac_OS)">Keychain</a> to keep track of them.</p>

<p>I manage myself using lists. Lately, I've been hot on <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">Chrome</a> is the browser I prefer. I've bolstered Chrome with the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc">JSONView plugin</a>, the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cpngackimfmofbokmjmljamhdncknpmg">Google Screen Capture plugin</a>, the <a href="http://readable.tastefulwords.com/">Readable bookmarklet</a>, the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom">AdBlock plugin</a>, and the <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper bookmarklet</a>.</p>

<p>I spend most of my development time in <a href="http://pydev.org/">PyDev</a> (which is a <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> centric bundling of <a href="http://eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>).</p>

<p>If I'm coding and I'm not in PyDev, I'm probably doing some quick proof of concept scripting or doing some <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>/Web development . For this type of work I'll use <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> if I'm working locally and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi">vi</a> if I'm working remotely.</p>

<p>We track code using <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> and push almost all work to <a href="https://github.com/harvard-lil">GitHub</a>. We use <a href="https://github.com/blog/831-issues-2-0-the-next-generation">GitHub Issues</a> for project management. We really dig GitHub in the lab.</p>

<p>GitHub encourages <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> for READMEs and the like. When I write Markdown, I use <a href="http://joncom.be/experiments/markdown-editor/edit/">Jon Combe's online editor</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.spotify.com/">Spotify</a> for tunes.</p>

<p>I use <a href="http://skype.com">Skype</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a> to communicate with those outside the office. IRC happens through <a href="http://colloquy.info/">Colloquy</a>.</p>

<p>I like to check the weather to see if I'll be able to spin the bicycle around for a few miles after work. I'm into <a href="http://weatherspark.com">WeatherSpark</a> for forecasts.</p>

<p><a href="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2012/06/matt_setup_desk-e1340592975240.jpg"><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2012/06/matt_setup_desk-e1340592975240.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p><strong>What would be your dream setup?</strong></p>

<p>I could go wild with the dream setup, but I feel like bounding it a bit. Here's what I think might be feasible in a couple years with a generous office budget.</p>

<p>I want a really great laptop. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Pro">third generation, i7, Retina display, 15 inch MacBook Pro</a>. I'd pair it with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Thunderbolt_Display">27" Apple Thunderbolt Display</a>. I'd pile all of that on a standing/sitting desk.</p>

<p>I'd also create an ideal office space. No office mates. A glass wall that insulates sound very well. I want to be able to see what's going on in the common work areas and I want people to see that they can get me if needed, but I don't want the noise when I'm focusing. I'm sold on the <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/12/29.html">Joel Spolsky office setup</a>.</p>

<p>Quick access to great coffee and water would be nice too.</p>

<p>My name is Jessica and I'm hanging out at here for the summer to work on a <a href="http://osc.hul.harvard.edu/liblab">Library Lab</a> project called Time/Slice. The idea behind it is that activity and events are part of the "data" associated with a community, but that there is no one responsible for organizing/archiving/analyzing them as such. Time/Slice is a digital bulletin board for a physical place (eg a school or neighborhood) which can be housed in the library associated with that community. It takes event submissions via email with photo/video attachments. It can also pull in video of previous events (from youtube/vimeo feeds, etc.) Everything is added and sorted automatically.</p>

<p>I started the project in the <a href="http://librarytestkitchen.org/">Library Test Kitchen</a> course with Jeff last semester, focusing on the Harvard Graduate School of Design and <a href="http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/#/loeblibrary/index.html">Loeb Library</a>. I ended up with a prototype that is functional but pretty buggy. You can still <a href="http://www.jessyurko.com/timeslice/index.html">check it out here</a>. (The animated blocks are entirely the work of the awesome <a href="http://isotope.metafizzy.co/">isotope jQuery plugin.</a>)</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2012/06/Screen-shot-2012-06-14-at-12.41.11-PM.jpg" alt="time/slice prototype" /></p>

<p>There were a couple of problems with it that I'm working on fixing now: speed, storing images, navigability, and a whole lot of bugs. There are also issues around how much volume it can be expected to handle, and it needs to have an easy interface for whoever's in charge to edit content.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2012/06/Screen-shot-2012-06-14-at-12.46.35-PM.jpg" alt="current version screenshot" />
current version as of this morning. not too pretty yet, eh?</p>

<p>I'll post a link to what I'm working on now when it's a little more stable.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We've been having fun with the Awesome Box lately. Signage work.</p>

<p>We started low-tech for <a href="/blog/2012/05/17/awesome-box-pilot/">the two prototype boxes we installed last month.</a> Just a little time in Photoshop and a color printer.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2012/06/IMG_0240-e1339469087348.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The paper sign has some strengths. It's low cost and easy to reproduce should it get damaged. But, it really doesn't scream "Awesome." If I checked out the paper sign from my local sign lending library, I probably wouldn't return it to the Awesome Box. Let's punch up the fun.</p>

<p>How about a sign with lights? Yes, please.</p>

<p>We've rigged up an Arduino with a photoresistor and wired that to a few LEDs. Those LEDs get routed into a sheet of plexiglass and then sandwiched between a couple of sheets of aluminum. Place a book inside, trip the sensor, and smile.</p>

<div class="embed-container"><iframe width="320" height="240" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/43864998?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

<p>(The wires and the rest of the circuit will be cleaned up and hidden in the base of the Awesome Box.)</p>

<p>For situations in which the LED-based sign is not a good fit, we're putting together an aluminum and felt sign. The thick felt will be sandwiched between two aluminum arrows much like the LED sign. Fun and stable.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2012/06/IMG_0237-e1339444055765.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Stan Cotreau in the <a href="http://www.physics.harvard.edu/services/machineshop/">Harvard Physics Machine Shop</a> has been helping us fabricate the aluminum and plexi. Thanks, Stan.</p>

<p>Yes Ma'am that's right, you counted correctly.  We have 16 full beautiful pages, 8 double-wides, of broadside in grayscale with a spot color of cyan.  These pages describe in words and pictures the awesome projects of the students.  Head on over to the <a href="http://www.librarytestkitchen.org/">website</a> if you wanna watch the recorded magic.</p>

<p><a href="http://lincoprinting.com/">Linco Printing</a> out of Long Island City NY provided the printing services.  Getting assets encoded and laid out appropriately for a two-color job (black and cyan) in photoshop and indesign isn't trivially quick.  But now that I've done it once….</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here is a letter from our very own Paul Deschner, to the Harvard Library community (and—now—beyond).  It was so well received here that we thought it worth sharing more broadly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hi all,</p>

  <p>During this time of general re-evaluation of library services, I thought
it might be helpful to share a few thoughts from my vantage point as a
software developer at the Harvard Library Innovation Lab regarding the
relationship between our catalogers (we're in the Law Library) and the
data they create and software development for library applications.</p>

  <p>My project work at the Lab has time and again shown the crucial
importance not simply of cataloged records, but of cataloged records
created to a high standard.  I work primarily on data platforms,
harvesting bibliographic and related data and making it accessible to
other developers who create amazing tools and services for library
communities.</p>

  <p>One of the primary challenges in this work is getting data describing
books and periodicals (catalog records) to relate to data from
non-library sources, such as data about book talks on YouTube or to NPR
broadcasts of author interviews or to archival collections.  It's all
about connections in the data.  The barer the data, the less described
it is, the more it falls flat.</p>

  <p>On the bibliographic side, every new Library of Congress subject heading
a cataloger adds to a record creates a rich set of connective
possibilities downstream for people like me.  Likewise, every uniform
title entry inserted into a record allows us to show users of our
software another edition of a given work in the context of all its
editions – a crucial feature for any discovery service in the library
materials space.</p>

  <p>No software can create these connections if the underlying data hasn't
been carefully composed into richly structured records, based on solid
analysis and comprehensive description.  The difference is like that
between reading a newspaper consisting of headlines only and reading one
which also has accompanying articles.  It is dramatic.</p>

  <p>I hope in moving forward that we don't lose sight of the importance of
this kind of quality analysis and description.</p>

  <p>But also: the expertise which catalogers bring to the task of
comprehensive bibliographic description has proven crucial to me as a
reference resource in my work of designing software to harvest and
process bibliographic information.  At the Law Library, the catalogers
are a few hallway steps away, and are as crucial to my being able to
create smart software as anyone on my development team.  I've spent
countless hours, regularly throughout the years, with my cataloger
colleagues exploring the complexities of MARC data structures, uniform
title rulesets, authority record uses, holdings data locations, and much
much more.  Having them as a co-located resource has been crucial to my
being able to get my software written.</p>

  <p>There are some amazing cross-departmental symbioses here in the Harvard
Library, as well as some crucial, perhaps non-obvious, dependencies
between departments.  From where I'm sitting, they comprise a major,
wonderfully effect part of our current ecosystem.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Awesome Box is now well beyond the pilot phase. Visit <a href="http://awesomebox.io">awesomebox.io</a> to learn how to get one at your library.</p>

<p>The Harvard community now has the chance to declare something Awesome. Just by dropping it in a box. Amazing, useful and entertaining library materials can now be returned to the Awesome Boxes in Widener and Lamont.</p>

<p>Check out what's been Awesomed already at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150919182025/http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/awesome/">http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/awesome</a>.</p>

<p>This pilot phase is intended to help figure out how to make the boxes user friendly &amp; intuitive and also how best to integrate the Awesome Box into library staff workflow. Getting the signage right is key to the first goal. It's been a challenge to perfect the balance between simple and informative.</p>

<p>We want users to understand the following without using too much text.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What constitutes Awesome (helpful, mind-blowing, etc.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What happens when an item is Awesomed (it gets marked Awesome, shared with everyone)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Placing an item in the Awesome Box actually returns it to the library</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully more Awesome Boxes will get released into the wild soon.  In the meantime, return an Awesome item to Widener or Lamont, check out what's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150919182025/http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/awesome/">Recently Awesome</a>, and let us know what you think.</p>

<p>Learn <a href="http://osc.hul.harvard.edu/liblab/proj/awesome-box">more about the project</a>.</p>

<p>We were at DPLA West to chat about the DPLA, our work on the <a href="http://dp.la/dev/wiki/">Platform</a>, and the recent <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/dplaalpha/2012/04/06/dpla-hackathon-gives-developers-first-look-at-dpla-platform/">DPLA Hackfest</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2012/05/IMG_0139-e1336163643710.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The event was held at the <a href="http://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> and at the <a href="http://sfpl.org/">San Francisco Public Library</a>. Wonderful venues.</p>

<p>[<a href="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2012/05/IMG_01261-e1336163273737.jpg"></a></p>

<p>One of the highlights of the event was a tour the Internet Archive's physical archive.</p>

<p>We just concluded class #2 of the <a href="http://www.librarytestkitchen.org/">Library Test Kitchen</a>, our experimental seminar in the <a href="http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/#/news/all-news/feed.html">Graduate School of Design</a>.  The course is a collaboration between <a href="http://jeffreyschnapp.com/">Jeffrey Schnapp</a> (Professor of Romance Languages &amp; Literature, Director of <a href="http://metalab.harvard.edu/">metaLab</a>) Ann Whiteside (Director, <a href="http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/#/loeblibrary/index.html">Frances Loeb Library</a>), Ben Brady (GSD) and me (Jeff Goldenson).  It is the continuation of a seminar this past Fall entitled Bibliotheca, the Library Past/Present/Future.  There are many other folks involved in the Test Kitchen—people from the Innovation Lab, the greater Harvard Library and metaLab, who are taking part, and we're just at the beginning.</p>

<p>As described on <a href="http://www.librarytestkitchen.org/">www.librarytestkitchen.org</a>, this is a seminar about making.  A prototyping lab for libraries. Our goal is to create products, services &amp; experiences, broadly defined, for the Harvard Library community. Generous funding to realize these projects is provided by <a href="http://history.fas.harvard.edu/people/faculty/darnton.php">Prof. Robert Darnton</a> and the <a href="http://osc.hul.harvard.edu/liblab">Harvard Library Lab</a>. Projects will be deployed in «Test Kitchens»—partner libraries, such as the <a href="http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/#/loeblibrary/index.html">Loeb</a> and <a href="http://hcl.harvard.edu/libraries/widener/">Widener</a> Libraries, that allocate portions of their public space to these experiments.</p>

<p>There's a hypothesis at the heart of this seminar.  Perhaps the students know what the future of the library should be, better than we (library staff) do.  So lets put them in the drivers seat and find out.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/podcast/2012-02-02_marilynjohnson.ogg"><strong>Also in ogg</strong></a>)</p>

<p>"Your average citizen is not technologically savvy," says Marilyn Johnson, the author of <a href="http://www.marilynjohnson.net/_i_this_book_is_overdue___i__89022.htm"><em>This Book Is Overdue!: How Librarians and Cybrarians Can Save Us All</em></a></p>

<p><img src="http://img2.imagesbn.com/images/103450000/103453946.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Even as technology takes over more and more of our lives many of us are living in a technology cemetery, filled with old gadgets we have no idea how to revive, computers we don't know how to program, and ebooks we have no idea how to download to.</p>

<p>Johnson argues that this is a huge opportunity for libraries to revive their place as centers of the community, for librarians to exist not just as oracles of the reference book, but as guides to the technical world.</p>

<p>She spoke with David Weinberger about exactly how this might happen.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.educause.edu/Community/MemDir/Profiles/AlisonJHead/63775">Alison Head</a>, who is spending time with us at the LiL as she simultaneously is a Fellow at the Harvard <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu">Berkman Center</a>—she is the co-diorector of <a href="http://projectinfolit.org">Project Information Literacy</a> at the Univ. of Washington's Information School—spoke with us about a new study she's done with Michael Eisenberg [<a href="http://projectinfolit.org/pdfs/PIL_Fall2011_TechStudy_FullReport1.2.pdf">pdf</a>] about what students are actually doing with their electronic companions when in the library during "crunch time" (two weeks before exams). Are they multitasking? Are they playing games or Facebooking instead of studying? Are they managing their devices, or are their devices managing them?</p>

<p>In this interview, Alison explains that answers are of course complex, but that overall, The Kids are managing well…and that this may give some hints about the future of libraries.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/podcast/2011-11-01_kelly.ogg"><strong>Also in ogg</strong></a>)</p>

<p>The way we search for information on the web has antecedents in the way search works in traditional libraries and research journals. There's metadata, and there's also a sense of allowing the content that is most cited to float to the top.</p>

<p>So why the library of the future still being waylaid?</p>

<p>While research journals and paywalled sites often have an advantage when it comes to organization and quality of content, sites like Wikipedia dominate the educational web due to their openness and collaborative nature.</p>

<p>For Episode Nine David Weinberger spoke with <a href="http://www.kk.org/"><strong>Kevin Kelly</strong></a>—journalist and author of the book What Technology Wants—about search, openness, and the future of the library.</p>

<p>Snippets of recent happenings in the Lab:</p>

<h2 id="matt-phillips"><a href="/about/">Matt Phillips:</a></h2>

<p>I spent the week working on LibraryCloud News (a project that Jeff, David, and I have been batting around for a while). We hope LibraryCloud News will become the <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> for library dorks (instead of startup dorks). It's a place where you can submit questions or a link to the community and then engage the community
through comment-style discussion. (Exactly the way Reddit and Hacker News work) LibaryCloud News is powered by the same code that powers Hacker News and is humming along in the Amazon Cloud. If you're interested, we'd love to have you help us beta test LibraryCloud News at <a href="http://news.librarycloud.org">http://news.librarycloud.org/</a></p>

<h2 id="paul-deschner"><a href="/about/">Paul Deschner:</a></h2>

<p>I spent a good portion of the week researching and installing Hadoop (distributed data processing) and Mahout (machine-learning algorithms) on one of our servers and running test scripts, in preparation for doing large-scale textual analysis over full-text corpora and metadata.</p>

<h2 id="kimdulin"><a href="/about/">Kim Dulin:</a></h2>

<p>I recently was a member of a panel talking about DIY Libraries at the New School's <a href="http://mobilityshifts.org/">Mobility Shifts conference</a>. Fellow panelists were <a href="http://www.nypl.org/node/57186">Deanna Lee</a> of the New York Public Library, and <a href="http://www.brooklynpubliclibrary.org/execdirbio.jsp">Linda Johnson</a>, Director of Brooklyn Public Library. The three of us were asked to talk about how libraries' strategies for cultural outreach, and for supporting patrons' self-education, have evolved.   The New School's <a href="http://www.newschool.edu/lang/faculty.aspx?id=20484">Shannon Mattern</a>, moderated.   We had a wonderful audience of students, librarians and others interested in how libraries are expanding their roles, especially as it relates to DIY learning.   Lee gave a demonstration of <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nypl-biblion-worlds-fair/id433418206?mt=8">Biblion</a>, the NYPL's new ipad application for browsing its digital collections.   Johnson discussed ways that the Brooklyn Public Library is reaching out to citizens in the borough to boost computer literacy.   Johnson noted that over 40% of Brooklyn residents do not have any type of internet access.  To counter this, the Library has been lending laptops to users in the community, as well as providing computer classes, with great success.  I spoke about the Harvard Library Innovation Lab and our ShelfLife / Digital Public Library of America's Beta Sprint entry.    It was a fun and inspiring event.</p>

<h2 id="david-weinberger"><a href="/about/">David Weinberger:</a></h2>

<p>I participated in the Library Lab fair, where our Lab showed the two of its projects that received grants: LibraryCloud and a series of <a href="/blog/tag/podcast/">library innovation podcasts</a>.</p>

<h2 id="jeff-goldenson"><a href="/about/">Jeff Goldenson:</a></h2>

<p>Spent the week working on the <a href="http://library.law.harvard.edu/digitalexhibits/ruhleben/exhibits/show/ruhleben/">Ruhleben library exhibition</a>.</p>

<h2 id="annie-cain"><a href="/about/">Annie Cain:</a></h2>

<p>Was out most of the week on vacation.</p>

<p>While in the middle of working on some CSS3 transition effects, I just happened to see <a href="http://leaverou.github.com/prefixfree/">prefixfree</a> mentioned on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>.</p>

<p>How do you find the leading legal cases cited in law review journals throughout their publishing history?  This is the goal of an exploratory project now being set up by visiting scholar Richard Leiter in collaboration with the Innovation Lab.  The hope is to compile a list of the most frequently cited cases, and, depending on what is discovered, possibly facet these results by subject, law-review clusters, etc.  Our initial approach: set up a scripted parser for the inspection of plain-text OCR from sample law journal volumes (generously made available to us by Hein Online).  On the basis of these initial results, using the most basic pattern-matching, we identify case-citation passages which in turn allow us to further refine the parser.  Checking against the associated PDF's allows us to determine the degree to which we're successfully capturing citations and to identify new patterns for inclusion in the parser refinement work.  Additional parsing will be necessary to handle initial vs. subsequent case-citation formats, in-text vs. footnoted references, article tagging and textually non-standard citation locations (such as page-spanning citations).  The lessons learned here will hopefully scale to examining general corpora of OCR texts for citation data.</p>

<h2 id="matt-phillips"><a href="/about/">Matt Phillips:</a></h2>

<p>A couple of weeks ago I mashed up a, er, mashup: Find books in <a href="http://www.librarycloud.org">LibraryCloud</a> that are related to news items coming off <a href="http://developer.nytimes.com/docs/read/times_newswire_api">the New York Times Newswire</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111113062413/http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/projects/works-news/">Give it a try</a>.</p>

<p>The app is about as crude as it can get. The searching for books is done by keyword-matching NYT topics (each NYT piece gets a topic) with <a href="http://www.loc.gov/aba/cataloging/subject/">LCSH</a> (this crude matching is done in the crudest way). I think we can get much, much better matching with some more work: If we create links from DBPedia topics to LCSH, we can get really good, semantic, matching.</p>

<h2 id="david-weinberger"><a href="/about/">David Weinberger:</a></h2>

<p>I was very pleased that Dan Brickley this week <a href="http://danbri.org/words/2011/10/11/720">blogged</a> about the work he's been doing with the Lab on trying to figure out how to slot Web content into established library categories: How can a system automatically figure out that, say, a TED Talk about space travel ought to be clustered with the right Library of Congress Subject Headings? This is a phenomenally difficult problem because Web content can have very little metadata. Dan, has been exploring linked open data spaces, as well as some open source semantic extraction tools, to see if it can be done. We've been working with him all summer on this—which often means watching in amazement as he does his wizardry—which has led to his reporting that he is actually making some progress on this deep problem.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>We've been working with the brilliant <a href="http://danbri.org">Dan Brickley</a> all summer (he's very modest, so now I've embarrassed him) trying to figure out how to use all available metadata to slot Web content into library categorization schemes automagically. For example, if we include in our collection—or, more to the point, if the <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/dpla/Main_Page">DPLA</a> includes in its collection—library-worthy material such as <a href="http://www.ted.com">TED talks</a>, is there a way in which we could automatically categorize those talks within the general mix of library items? We'd like to be able to do this at scale, even if roughly.</p>

<p>No one knows linked open data better than Dan (there, I've embarrassed him again!), and he's been experimenting with all sorts of metadata and connections. Today he <a href="http://danbri.org/words/2011/10/11/720">posted</a> about what he's been up to. It's pretty damn fascinating, and our team has learned a ton working with him on this all summer. We're looking forward to more!</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We're really really really pleased that the <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/research/dpla">Digital Public Library of America</a> has <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/node/7115">chosen</a> two of our projects to be considered (at an Oct. 21 <a href="nhttp://cyber.law.harvard.edu/events/2011/10/dplaplenary">open plenary</a> meeting) for implementation as part of the DPLA's <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/newsroom/Digital_Public_Library_America_Beta_Sprint">beta sprint</a>.  We worked insanely hard all summer to turn our prototypes for Harvard into services suitable for a national public library. We're proud of what we accomplished, and below is a link that will let you try out what we came up with.</p>

<p>Upon the announcement of the beta sprint in May, we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160413203820/http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/dpla/">partnered up</a> with folks at thirteen other institutions… an amazing group of people. Our small team at Harvard, with generous internal support, built ShelfLife and LibraryCloud on top of the integrated catalogs of five libraries, public and university, with a combined count of almost 15 million items, plus circulation data. We also pulled in some choice items from the Web, including metadata about every TED talk, open courseware, and Wikipedia pages about books. (Finding all or even most of the Wikipedia pages about books required real ingenuity on the part of our team, and was a fun project that we're in the process of writing up.)</p>

<p>The metadata about those items goes into LibraryCloud, which collects and openly publishes that metadata via APIs and as linked open data. We're proposing LibraryCloud to DPLA as a metadata server for the data DPLA collects, so that people can write library analytics programs, integrate library item information into other sites and apps, build recommendation and navigation systems, etc. We see this as an important way what libraries know can become fully a part of the Web ecosystem.</p>

<p>ShelfLife is one of those possible recommendation and navigation systems. It is based on a few basic principles hypotheses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The DPLA should be not only a service but a <em>place</em> where people can not only read/view items, but can engage with  other users.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Library items do not exist on their own, but are always part of various webs. It's helpful to be able to switch webs and contexts with minimal disruption.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The behavior of the users of a collection of items can be a good guide to those items; we think of this as "community relevance," and calculate it as "shelfRank."</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The system should be easy to use  but enable users to drill down or pop back up easily.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Libraries are social systems. Library items are social objects. A library navigation system should be social as well.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Apparently the DPLA agreed enough to select ShelfLife and LibraryCloud along with five other projects out of 38 submitted proposals. The other five projects—along with another three in a "lightning round"—are very strong contenders and in some cases quite amazing. It seems clear to our team that there are synergies among them that we hope and assume the DPLA also recognizes. In any case, we're honored to be in this group, and look forward to collaborating no matter what the outcome.</p>

<p>You can try the prototype of ShelfLife and LibraryCloud <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160415064021/http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/dpla/demo/">here</a>. Keep in mind please that this is live code running on top of a database of 15M items in real time, and that it is a prototype (and in certain noted areas merely a demo or sketch). We urge you to talk the tour first; there's a lot in these two projects that you'll miss if you don't.</p>

<p>How can libraries use the power of metadata—those little molecules of information that help describe the greater work—to help users get more out of their search for resources?</p>

<p>With the web, people are reading more than ever before you could say. But what are we reading? Likely it's all short form: blog posts, tweets, status updates. They're words, but it's not exactly <em>literature</em>.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3276/2816757327_37f7f06103_o.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>But innovators attempting to bridge the gap between literacy and the social web have found that there's not only a huge appetite for books, but that the web can actually make the experience of reading books more enjoyable.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.librarything.com/"><strong>LibraryThing</strong></a> is one of those innovations. A social network with links to tens of millions of books in its database, LibraryThing connects readers to one another to discuss, share recommendations, and generally celebrate literature.</p>

<p>David Weinberger spoke with LibraryThing founder Tim Spalding about what libraries can learn from their successful experiment with the digital book club.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First, an email from Brewster Kahle of the <a href="http://www.archive.org">Internet Archive</a> about Michael S. Hart:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A dear friend and an inspiration unfortunately died yesterday.</p>

  <p>He dedicated his life to getting books to everyone in the world. He did this with no compensation and lived a life of near poverty. But he always shined with good cheer, optimism, and high respect for others. I got to know him through Project Gutenberg twenty years ago. Visiting him in his house was a joy—it was stacked high with books all around, and a glowing green terminal in the basement where he first helped type in the classics and then lead thousands of volunteers to bring over 37,000 books online as beautifully edited ebooks. A forward thinker, in the same light as Richard Stallman and Ted Nelson, who saw how the world could benefit from our digital tools. Every reading device I have ever come across always started with the Gutenberg Project collection including our Internet Bookmobile.</p>

  <p>On first meeting him, I remember dodging traffic with him as we walked calmly across Lakeside Blvd in Chicago (which is a highway and extremely dangerous). He said he did this in normal course when he was growing up. The cop let us get away with only a warning.</p>

  <p>Another Michael flare is that he wrote email that was "right justified" by changing the words to end at the right place—I have never known another to do this. He said that he did this to avoid text editors reflowing his text and "destroying my phraseology". For instance below are two letters from this summer, and I included <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Michael_S._Hart">Greg Newby's obituary</a>.</p>

  <p>A special man, a guiding light, a good friend. I miss him.</p>

  <p>-brewster</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is the first of the two letters Brewster mentions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On 7/16/11 4:38 AM, Michael S. Hart wrote:</p>

  <p>A Graceful Exit</p>

  <p>As most of my friends know, I have accomplished all of the goals I have set for myself throughout my life, and I think I can say, without fear of too much repercussive responses, that the career I have chosen in eBooks has been a success in terms of what I've been trying to accomplish for these last four decades.</p>

  <p>At the same time, I do realize that other persons have had other ideas/ideals about eBooks, who have called me everything from an outright raging Communist, to sincere Socialist, to unqualified, in terms of membership…. not ability… member of Capitalists Exploiting The World… no kidding.  I do realize that is might be difficult for persons living on the other side of this world, given the information they have to work with, to view me, or any other American, as anything other than a Capitalist Imperialist, so I bear less in the way of ill feelings about this.</p>

  <p>However, now the time has come to talk of other things.</p>

  <p>Yes, I do have one more impossible goal I dream of, but I do not believe I can accomplish it in the same manner I accomplished an assortment of previous goals, with a combination of persistence, ability, and convincing others to give me unofficial assistance, as I face a combination of limited time, limited resources and I must admit, declining energy levels, though I still manage to do more work than I ever did before.</p>

  <p>However, I do realize that without some serious changed in life, there is little possibility of accomplishing my last goal with a lifestyle continuing in the same vein.</p>

  <p>Therefore, I now would like to remind you of my last goals:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>A Billion eBook Library</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Spending More Time In Hawaii</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Working To Create A Graceful Exit</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>Here are the details:</p>

  <p>A Billion eBook Library</p>

  <p>Premise #1:</p>

  <p>There are ~25 million books in the public domain.</p>

  <p>If we do ~40% of these that will be ~10 million eBooks.</p>

  <p>Premise #2:</p>

  <p>There are ~250 languages with over a million speakers.</p>

  <p>If we do ~40% of these that will be ~100 languages.</p>

  <p>Conclusion:</p>

  <p>10 million eBooks translated into 100 languages yields</p>

  <p>ONE BILLION eBOOKS</p>

  <p>Note:  I realize how impossible this sounds, given the powerful lack of interest by thousands of translators, and other experts I have contacted, but given previous personal experiences shared by each of you and myself, I think we must realize it IS possible, even if we are going to have to do all to much of it ourselves.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, I plan to devote a serious amount of the time I have remaining to doing the setup required.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Spending More Time In Hawaii</li>
  </ol>

  <p>As most of you know, Hawaii was just too laid back for me to stay there more than a month at a time when this opportunity first appeared.</p>

  <p>However, you must also realize that from 1999 to 2011, I obviously have aged 12 years, and the difference for me between 52, when I could still pretend to be ~40's, and today, when there is little pretending possible, I am now much more likely to spend at least half my time there, if not even more, given that I might expect the pressures to increase to abandon my Illinois residence for various and sundry reasons we should maybe discuss when we get together next.</p>

  <p>However, I can tell you that pressures of Winter, here in Illinois, plus those of advancing age, make it more and more difficult to look forward to more of this.</p>

  <p>I should add that even though Spring is my favorite of all the seasons, this spring was an effort, but with a lot of luck I once again managed to do all I planned.</p>

  <p>However, I must also admit that this, too, will get to be more and more difficult as the years progress.</p>

  <p>Therefore I am very glad to announce that I have a job with John in Hawaii that will, when needed, provide me with the ability to live in a neighboring apartment to John's for as much of the year as I would like, and we will see how this works out starting this Winter.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>A Graceful Exit</li>
  </ol>

  <p>I would like to support all the efforts I have before, plus the final one I have listed above, without any of repercussions that could take place with I shuffle off this mortal coil.</p>

  <p>In some ways I would like to simply work behind scenes as much as possible so I won't be missed when I'm gone from those activities, but I also realize that my name just might be worth something in public relations so I leave some of that decision open for your advice.</p>

  <p>As John and Greg can testify, I am still capable of an awful lot of Newsletter writing, though it does take a toll, particularly when I have lots more to do for the other portions of my life.  Again, I leave this open a lot for your advice.</p>

  <p>Please refer to the previous message I sent about work on setting up a new, and much different kind of setup, for The Billion eBook Project, I will resend it.</p>

  <p>If I/we play our cards right, perhaps I can leave this scene without causing undue trouble, and perhaps I can even manage it in absentia as some kind of motivation, perhaps setting some goal, perhaps even some rewarding procedures for accomplishment.</p>

  <p>I, personally, do not think the world at large really, sincerely wants to provide literacy and education from anyone to The Third World, in spite of all lip service to the contrary… so I warn you that the possibility exists that this project will not be supported from an outside set of sources that I still plan to approach—so you might find that you are more on your own that I would like to hope, and that you might have to expect, really, a future that is more like the past, in terms, sadly to say, of having to do a LOT of this work on an individual basis more than having the world's support.</p>

  <p>I hope you feel up to the task… you will be tempted more and more to rest from exhaustion as you get older and older… the all nighters will turn into just get up early when the air is clear, but you will also find that what you can accomplish in those fewer hours will be more than you ever did before, because experience's power is greater than you might think today.</p>

  <p>That is what I leave you with…</p>

  <p>Another goal that is nigh well on to impossible.</p>

  <p>Little hope of finding any real world support.</p>

  <p>And the hope that your experience will leverage future endeavors for you as much as it has for me.</p>

  <p>I hope you can put enough into these efforts that I am able to depart as gracefully as is possible these days.</p>

  <p>Hoping to thank you soon for your time &amp; consideration,</p>

  <p>Michael</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thank you for the gift, Michael. Rest in peace.</p>

<p>Some might assume that libraries and museums have outlived their purpose. When every book and archive can be recreated and reinterpreted digitally to create an incredible user experience, how is the physical and human infrastructure of the institution still necessary?</p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3593/4603316902_76443bea98_b.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>It's a challenging question, but libraries and museums aren't finding themselves replaced by the internet, as the cynical might assume. In fact, their roles as curators and archivists are becoming more important than ever.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.imls.gov/about/staffdetail.aspx?StaffId=18"><strong>Susan Hildreth</strong></a> is the director of the <a href="http://www.imls.gov/"><strong>Institute of Museum and Library Services</strong></a> which serves the nation's 123,000 libraries and 17,500 museums.</p>

<p>Susan recently got on the phone with Harvard Library Innovation Lab's very own David Weinberger to talk about the role these brick and mortar institutions play in the digital age.</p>

<p>If you've worked in technology at all you probably recognize the name "O'Reilly"—it has become practically synonymous with "tech help." For anyone who has tried to code a line of html, or figure out what the heck that icon on the iPhone screen is, O'Reilly Media has produced a manual to explain it.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/177/476780331_32f2f3b71b_b.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>In the digital age shelves weighted down with books like these are becoming less and less common. Creators are turning more to online resources and tutorials to help them with specific issues. But, as you might expect from a forward thinking technology company, O'Reilly has been there to meet their readers.</p>

<p>Part of this has been due to the initiative of O'Reilly's founder Tim O'Reilly who has <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonbruner/2011/03/25/tim-oreilly-on-piracy-tinkering-and-the-future-of-the-book/"><strong>seen an e-book revolution coming</strong></a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4004/4356098671_ebb4330857_b.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Tim recently sat down with Harvard Library Innovation Lab's very own David Weinberger to talk about using the web to curate and archive knowledge, and what innovations publishers like he have to take on in order to survive.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://osc.hul.harvard.edu/liblab">Harvard Library Lab</a>, which issues grants for library innovation at the University, is holding a forum in which <a href="http://osc.hul.harvard.edu/liblab/prop1">all the projects</a> get 5 mins to introduce themselves. (The names prefacing these blurbs are of the presenters, who are not always the project leads or developers.)</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: Live-blogging.</strong> Getting things wrong. Missing points. Omitting key information. Introducing artificial choppiness. Over-emphasizing small matters. Paraphrasing badly. Not running a spellpchecker. Mangling other people's ideas and words. You are  <em>warned</em>, people.</p>

<p>Sebastian Diaz: Slideshow generator. Makes it easy to create slideshows out of images from image repositories. It initially is using the <a href="http://via.lib.harvard.edu/via/">VIA</a> repository. You can search by keyword, select the slides, set the delay between slides, and publish it. It's intended for classroom use, or, of course, for anyone.</p>

<p>Sebastian Diaz: Enhanced Social Tagging for Classifiation and Current Awareness. It's currently under development. (The code is at <a href="https://github.com/berkmancenter/taghub">Github</a>.) It enables the merging of tag sets that use different vocabularies without having to define a dictionary ahead of time. The tool produces a filter, "and you aggregate based on that filter," renaming tags (or associating them?) based on the filter. People can make their own aggregated feed out of these multiple tag sets. It's a form of behavior-driven development.</p>

<p>Sebastian Diaz: Deposit@Harvard. This tool eases the process of adding open access material to open access repositories, including <a href="http://dash.harvard.edu/">Harvard DASH</a>. This is an issue because not all repositories have the same APIs or metadata definitions.</p>

<p>Abigail Bourdeaux: The Copyright and Fair Use Tool: An interactive workflow tool for those trying to determine the copyright status, and fair use status, of materials, particularly for use in the classroom.  (It has not yet begun coding.)</p>

<p>Abigail Bourdeaux: Online Digital Atlas Viewer. This is a viewer designed specifically for viewing historical atlases online. These atlases may have overlap from page to page, may switch scales, etc. ODAV will help to reconcile maps through <a href="http://www.openlayers.org/">Open Layers</a>, to overlap and scale them seamlessly. (It has not yet begun coding.)</p>

<p>Marc MGee and Dave Siegel: Enhanced Catalog Searching with Geospatial Technology. They're working on ways to spatially search information in the Harvard Library system. They're using <a href="http://hul.harvard.edu/ois/systems/webservices/lookup-userguide/wwhelp/wwhimpl/js/html/wwhelp.htm">PRESTO Web Services</a> tools. They've taken 1,700 MARC records and sent them to <a href="http://www.Metacarta.com">Metacarta</a>, a geocoding company. Metacarta assigns lat/long to words it's extracted from text. They then put markers on a map to show docs relevant to those places.</p>

<p>Bobbi Fox: Library Application Collaboration Development Tools and Resources: How we can better coordinate library innovation at Harvard. They've reactivated the ABCD Library discussion group, which has been a "roaring success." They've also been talking with groups all across the library system about what would help. They're also coordinating with the new University CTO. From the small group discussions they've confirmed that everyone wants simple and convenient ways to keep up with the various projects, but we tend to disagree about what "simple and convenient" means :) Also, it's clear we need to work get over the cultural barriers against sharing what we're doing. Most people are not all that excited about centrally provided services such as bug tracking or source code management.</p>

<p>Justin Daost, Chris Erdmann: Wolbach User Experience Lab. The center for astrophysics got a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en/us/default.aspx">Microsoft Surface</a>, which interacts with objects near its surface via infrared cameras. They've been working with Microsoft Research to see how it could be use in the Library. Microsoft also connected them with Andy van Dam at Brown U. where they're working on the <a href="http://dl.lib.brown.edu/garibaldi/about.html">Garibaldi Project</a>, a way of browsing a set of related content.  They've been working on the LADS project that lets people scroll through a timeline, zoom in on high res images (without using much memory), click on hotspots that display related metadata, etc. They are using this to give access to special collections.  Also, they created an interface to enable librarians to update it easily.</p>

<p>Andy Wilson: QR Codes in the Library: This project would put QR in the stacks that would load onto a mobile device research guides relevant to that area of the stacks. They will spend the fall semester gathering more usage data before going to full implementation; they want to make sure people will actually use it.</p>

<p>Skip Kendall and  Andrea Goethals: Zone 1 Rescue Repository:  1. Working with faculty members to look at their own personal archive (personal papers, etc.), and to think about policy recommendations.  2. The Rescue Repository is a place to put content the final destination of which is not yet known.; it's a type of staging area, for use by anyone at Harvard, with very low barriers to getting content in. People can nominate content for long-term preservation. Content can be exported into other repositories. It will be open source software.  (MIT is collaborating on this project).</p>

<p>Carli Spina and Kim Dulin: Library Analytics Toolkit: An open source, highly configurable dashboard for viewing library statistics. It will be configurable for individuals, departments, entire libraries, etc.  By having it in similar formats, libraries will be able to compare their data. It will be widget-based and extensible, drawing data from standard data collectors, and will be built on existing dashboards (e.g. NCSU, Brown U., and the Watson Library at the Met). It is at the wireframe stage.</p>

<p>Cheryl McGrath: Interactive Carrel Seating App: Currently getting a carrel requires a bunch of paperwork and staff time. People have a wide variety of requests: Near a bathroom, in sunlight, no glare at sunset, are there crumbs in it, etc. This open source app lets users browse and search, and reserve the carrel. Carrel users can also post msgs to one another. The team thinks this app may save 5 weeks of labor for a staff member per year.</p>

<p>Library Innovation Podcasts: That's my project: <a href="/blog/category/podcast/">/blog/category/podcast/</a></p>

<p>Chip Goines: DRS Access for Mobil Devices: Creating an API to enable mobile devices to locate items in a "page-turned digital research" object, returning info about that particular page. [<a href="http://osc.hul.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/Mobile_DRS_Access_final.pdf">pdf</a>]</p>

<p>Kimberly Hall: The Connected Scholar: "Building ideas and exploring sources within an online culture of attribution." It lets researchers track what they're looking at/copying/jotting down, and enables collaboration in the management of information resources.  This should help scholars see where their ideas are coming from, to better understand their creative process." It should also help students develop the habit of attributing sources. Students will be able to see their research process through the tool.</p>

<p>Reinhard Engels: Highbrow: A textual annotation browser that displays the density of references to a text. E.g., you can plot the Biblical references in Aquinas, St. Augustine, Martin Luther, and Maimonides. (Augustine is more interested in Psalms than Aquinas was, and no one is interested in Mark.) You can zoom in on the line chart until you get to the actual text. The source text preferably should have a clear coordinate system (e.g., chapter and verse, or numbered lines of poetry). In working with Dante references, Reinhard has hit scaling issues: one set of commentators has almost 300,000 annotations.  So, he slices them by century, or by various other facets.  Or you can browse by line and see how many annotations there, and what they are. He's now working interactive annotations, enabling students and researchers to enter annotations.</p>

<p>Tom Dawson: <a href="http://yana.champsnotchumps.org">Yana</a>: "an open source template for scholarly journals to develop mobile apps." "Yana" is Sanskrit for "vehicle.") "The goal of the Yana project is to provide a light-weight, modular, open source template within which open acccess publishers can develop their own mobile applications." The aim is to make it easier for journals to do open access publishing on mobiles.</p>

<p>I talked about LibraryCloud, and Matt Phillips did a demo. LibraryCloud is an open library metadata server. It's coming along well.</p>

<p>James Burns, Jesse Shapins: <a href="http://extramuros.zeega.org/demo/">extraMUROS</a>. The aim is to provide a multimedia library without walls. It will bring together collections from all over and let users browse and search, curate in their own fashion, and be able to publish collections. James and Jesse show an early build of their browser that lets you quickly scan multiple collections. (Very cool.)  You can drag objects into a scratch space—either collections or individual items. It can look at the items you're choosing in order to refine your search. There's a map view that is also very cool. It even has a 3D view (No, no glasses required :) And a timeline view.</p>

<p>Q: Will you fund non-tech-heavy proposals?</p>

<p>A: Yes!</p>

<p>Q: Could these be sources of revenue for the Library?</p>

<p>A: Nope. It's open source for the greater good of libraries.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A <a href="http://crc.nottingham.ac.uk/projects/rcs/Chemists&amp;EconomistsViews_on_OA.pdf">report</a> on a survey of 350 chemists and 350 economists in  UK universities leads to the following conclusion about open access publishing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…our work with researchers on the ground indicates to us that whatever the enthusiasm and optimism within the OA community, it has not spilled into academia to a large extent and has had only a small effect on the publishing habits and perceptions of ordinary researchers, whatever their seniority and whether in Chemistry or Economics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The report finds that faculty members want to publish in high "impact factor" journals unless they have some specific reason why they should go the Open Access route, e.g., they need to get something out quickly. The subscriptions their libraries buy mask from them the extent to which their work becomes inaccessible to those who are not a university.</p>

<p>The report ends with some recommendations for trying to move academics towards OA publishing.</p>

<p>Guarding patron privacy is kind of the default in the library business. When it comes to knowing who checked out what and when libraries usually prefer to flush the cache—except when it comes to collecting fines!</p>

<p><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6015/5920281397_65ac967718_o.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>But in an age of public Amazon purchase lists, automatic tweets, and even sites setup to automatically share users' credit card statements with the world at large, are libraries simply living in the past?</p>

Jeff Jarvis, in public</p>

<p>That's what <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/"><strong>Jeff Jarvis</strong></a> suggests.</p>

<p>A professor at the City University of New York's Graduate School of Journalism, and one of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/mar/15/sxsw-2011-jeff-jarvis-prostate-cancer-publicness"><strong>the web's most notorious oversharers</strong></a>, Jeff Jarvis sat down with Harvard Library Innovation Lab's very own David Weinberger to talk about how the library can merge the values of privacy with the web's power to share.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4070/5133979718_9ba39f8b38.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>It starts with an idea: You're a scholar and you use the web to search for sources. How can you collect your sources and their metadata without having to copy, paste, reformat? Or spend your starving researcher's budget on some proprietary software?</p>

<p>That's only the beginning for <a href="http://www.zotero.org/"><strong>Zotero</strong></a>, a free, open-source plug-in for web browsers developed by the <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/"><strong>Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media</strong></a> at George Mason University.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2550/4089542428_f25bb4669e_o.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Zotero allows researchers to do much more than harness the power of the web to save citations. There is also a robust social component that allows researchers to share their research <em>in progress</em>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dancohen.org/bio/"><strong>Dan Cohen</strong></a> is the director of the Center for History and New Media and one of the minds behind the project. The Harvard Library Innovation Lab's very own David Weinberger caught up with Dan for this week's podcast to talk about Zotero, open syllabi, and other tools and ideas for enhancing and sharing research.</p>

<p>The idea behind the beta sprint is that anyone with an idea about what the DPLA should be, how it should work, what it can do, or what it should look like should embody that idea in code or documentation, and submit it by September 1.</p>

<p>We're proposing a version of <a href="/projects#shelflife-io">ShelfLife</a> re-thought for a  potentially massive set of users whose interests and computer skills range all over the lot. And we're proposing <a href="/projects#library-cloud">LibraryCloud</a> as a middleware metadata server both to support ShelfLife and to make DPLA's metadata available through open APIs and as Linked Open Data.</p>

<p>We've put up a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160413203820/http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/dpla/">page about our collaborative project</a>, including our 400-word proposal to the DPLA. We'd love to hear from you.</p>

The report concludes that anonymization remains an important safeguard, and that the risks of re-identification of individuals within a crowd of anonymized data are lower than many fear.</p>

<p>That's good news. All guarantees of anonymity are probabilistic, so having some evidence that if done right, anonymization can  preserve privacy to a reasonable degree is helpful as libraries try to gain some benefits - primarily, serving their users better - from anonymized data. It'll be even better as best practices, backed by math and experience, continue to emerge.</p>

<p><a href="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/podcast/2011-05-28_suber.ogg"><strong>Also in ogg</strong></a></p>

<p>Scholarly journals were once enormously expensive. Because they were pricey to produce — it took a lot of money to coordinate the peer review, and to edit, print, bind, and distribute all those volumes — access was pricey as well.</p>

<p>But digital publishing and collaboration has reduced many of the financial barriers to sharing research. And advocates of the "<a href="http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/overview.htm"><strong>Open Access</strong></a>" model of scholarly publishing argue that when research journals are freely and openly accessible scholarly work flourishes.</p>

<p>Open access has picked up steam over the years as <a href="http://www.doaj.org/"><strong>many journals</strong></a> have chosen to adopt the model from inception, and several more established journals have converted. The result has been an exponential growth in the number and kinds of articles that are easily accessible with the click of a button.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/hometoc.htm"><strong>Peter Suber</strong></a> — a fellow at Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society — is a leading policy strategist working for Open Access models. The Harvard Library Innovation Lab's very own David Weinberger caught up with Peter for this week's podcast to talk about Open Access, and the new challenges librarians face with making a growing body of digital scholarship actually usable and sortable.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of weeks ago while reading <a href="http://articles.boston.com/2011-05-15/bostonglobe/29546405_1_mit-lsd-debate">Jerome Lettvin's obituary</a> I noticed this gem:</p>

<p>"At MIT, his office in Building 20 was crammed with books, most overdue from the college library. Dr. Lettvin claimed he did not return them because the library would send him the students who wanted those books, and he would interview them as potential assistants."</p>

<p>Jerome was gaming the library. He was holding onto resources that like-minded individuals desired in order to make professional connections. Cool.</p>

<p>Jerome's approach clearly has some scaling problems and some issues surrounding content that can't be stacked in an office (digital content), but he was onto something. People connect through works held at the library and the library should encourage these connections. How do we do that? I'm not sure, but I'm giving it some thought.</p>

<p>It's a hard list to disagree with… especially if your team has been working on LibraryCloud as an open metadata server.</p>

<p><a href="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/podcast/2011-05-05_james.ogg"><strong>Also in ogg</strong></a></p>

<p>There's a lot of talk about what the future of publishing looks like. Designers and innovators draw up these artistic visualizations of tablets, touchscreens, and interactive multimedia literature mashups to illustrate the possibilities.</p>

<p>But one designer is thinking a lot more about what is lost in the transition from the physical book to the digital. In fact, his visualizations often flip the script by placing digital literature in the physical context.</p>

<p><a href="http://shorttermmemoryloss.com/"><strong>James Bridle</strong></a> is an editor, publisher, designer, and innovator. One of his most recent projects was <a href="http://booktwo.org/notebook/wikipedia-historiography/"><strong>a physical production</strong></a> of the complete changelogs from the Wikipedia entry on the Iraq War. The project amounted to twelve volumes of almost 7,000 pages, including all the changes, discussions, and arguments logged in the process of producing the never-complete Wikipedia article from December 2004 to November 2009.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4078/4931496475_55e8e5426e_b.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>He's created a number of other projects to highlight the impermanence of the web and provoke conversation on the e-book, both the efficiencies and deficiencies thereof. The Harvard Library Innovation Lab's very own David Weinberger spoke with James by Skype about his work for the first ever episode of Library Lab/The Podcast.</p>

<p>I say "surprisingly touching" because it is about metadata, after all.</p>

Since preserving our heritage is one of the key value of our libraries but not of Amazon, there are troubling consequences of turning libraries into distribution sites for corporate content.</p>

<p>I have heard a well-known Internet librarian (I'm keeping her/his name confidential because I didn't ask if I'm allowed to repeat and attribute this idea, although I'm 99% certain this person wouldn't mind) suggest that the way forward is for libraries to push to be allowed to buy e-books. But apparently buying and owning stuff is a crazy idea in the Age of the LicenseWeb.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the <a href="http://pinakes.org/whatispinakes.htm">Pinakes</a> page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pinakes is a non-commercial tool the aim of which is to offer a renewed historiographic approach to the classification of the scientific heritage. Thanks to the integration of different types of objects, such as instruments, manuscripts, texts, iconography etc. Pinakes aims at transforming the traditional approach to the primary sources of the history of science into a sort of archeology of scientific knowledge. In order to achieve this ambitious project it was necessary to design a model of data-base, Pinakes, able to bring different classes of objects and items into one environment.</p>

  <p>…</p>

  <p>Pinakes has been thought as a database capable of hosting different levels of data structuring. On the basis of the choiche of the target, the user might be able to manage data form a very specific level to a more general description of the items
classified.</p>

This is important not just because Alfa Aesar is one of the most important sources of that information. It also provides a model that could work outside of chemistry and science.</p>

<p>The data will be useful to the <a href="http://onschallenge.wikispaces.com/">Open Notebook Science solubility project</a>, and because Alfa has agreed to  Open Data access, it can be useful far beyond that. In return, the Open Notebook folks cleaned up Alfa's data, putting it into a clean database format, providing unique IDs (ChemSpiderIDs), and linking back to the Alfa Aesar catalog page.</p>

<p>Open Notebook then merged the cleaned-up data set with several others. The result was a set of 13,436 Open Data melting point values.</p>

<p>They then created a <a href="http://lxsrv7.oru.edu/~alang/meltingpoints/">Web tool for exploring the merged dataset</a>.</p>

<p>Why stop with melting points? Why stop with chemistry? Open data for, say, books could lead readers to libraries, publishers, bookstores, courses, other readers…</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[Update (March 19)]: Google turned down the Berkman Center application, which included our projects :( ]</p>

<p>We've put in for a couple of Summer of Code <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/gsoc/Library_Innovation_Lab">projects</a>, in conjunction with the Berkman Center:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1. Syllabus parser. Design, structure and populate an open repository of the information in college syllabi.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Assuming we get permission, figure out how to retrieve syllabi from Google. (If we don't get permission, we have a starter set of 500,000+ syllabi.)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Figure out how to parse the multiple and free-form formats syllabi are found in.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Design an appropriate and open data model for the information in syllabi.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Build a Web site with that provides useful end-user and API access to the syllabus data.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>2. Scholarly semantic web builder. The aim is to crawl the Google Books corpus looking for useful relationships among scholarly works. Such relationships only begin with citations/footnotes. What other semantic cues can be unearthed to see how scholarly books relate?</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Research the sorts of relations between books that would be of high value to scholars and researchers, in addition to footnotes.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Crawl the Google Books corpus to discover these relations [if Google grants permission].</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Make these relations accessible in an open way, especially in conjunction with the ShelfLife app that provides community-based wayfaring through Harvard Library's holdings for scholars and researchers.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Create interesting and understandable analytics based on the discovered relationships.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

</blockquote>

<p>We're now waiting to see if the proposals get accepted.</p>

<p>The rest of the Berkman proposals—many fun ones—are <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/gsoc/Main_Page">here</a>.</p>

<p>Says the article: "…if an agreement or an alternative delivery plan is not in place by January 2nd next year, researchers at Imperial and elsewhere will lose access to thousands of journals. But Deborah Shorley is determined to take it to the edge if necessary: 'I will not blink.'"</p>

(NPG claims that the rise in fees was due to the reduction of a discount from 88% to 50%. UC <a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/University%20of%20California%20Response%20to%20Nature%20Publishing%20Group.pdf">disputes</a> this.) In August of 2010, NPG and UC came to  <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/sciencefair/post/2010/08/university-of-california-scientists-wont-be-boycotting-nature/1">announced</a> "an agreement to work together to address the current licensing challenges as well as the larger issues of sustainability in the scholarly communication process."

OCLC and Cambridge are experimenting with ways to make bibliographic data openly available. Having a reliable, open, set of bibliographic records would encourage the development of innovative applications.

OCLC and Cambridge are experimenting with ways to make bibliographic data openly available. Having a reliable, open, set of bibliographic records would encourage the development of innovative applications. Or, put differently, not having a standard way to refer to books and other works has inhibited innovation. The main impediment has been the prohibitions in the licenses for this data. Perhaps this new project indicates a willingness to let an open, public catalog be created.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>OCLC Research and Cambridge University collaborate on Open Metadata project—28 Feb 2011</p>

  <p>Library information provider OCLC Research, US, and Cambridge University have announced that both organisations will jointly conduct a six-month, JISC-funded investigation into the value of making collection metadata openly available in a sustainable manner.</p>

  <p>The COMET (Cambridge OPen METadata) project will release a sub-set of bibliographic data from Cambridge University Library catalogues as linked data in multiple formats. This activity will test a number of technologies and methodologies for releasing open bibliographic data including XML, RDF, SPARQL, and JSON.</p>

  <p>To enhance linking options, records will be enriched using two OCLC Research services to assign FAST (Faceted Application of Subject Terminology) and VIAF (Virtual International Authority File) headings. This will allow for effective information retrieval and semantic interoperability.</p>

  <p>Starting in February 2011, COMET will document the availability of metadata for the library's collections which can be released openly in machine-readable formats and the barriers which prevent other data from being exposed in this way.</p>

  <p>It is expected that the project will bring value to the wider community by contributing substantially to the availability of open metadata. Linking to FAST and VIAF headings will demonstrate the potential usefulness of a structured semantic approach to data. The project will also look at the value data enrichment offers for resource discovery.</p>

        <title>Has HarperCollins lost its mind or its soul?</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[<em>Note: As always with posts on this blog, authors speak for themselves. - dw</em>]</p>

<p>HarperCollins has <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2011/02/25/harpercollins-to-lib.html">changed its agreement</a> with the main distributor of e-books to libraries: e-books will now become inaccessible after 26 checkouts.</p>

<p>I understand publishers' desire to limit ebook access so that selling one copy doesn't serve the needs of the entire world. But think about what this particular DRM bomb does to libraries, one of the longest continuous institutions of civilization. Libraries exist not just to lend books but to guarantee their continuous availability throughout changes in culture and fashion. This new licensing scheme prevents libraries from accomplishing this essential mission.</p>

<p>It's beyond ironic. Until now, libraries have in fact had to scale back on that mission because there isn't enough space for all the physical books they've acquired over the years. So, they get rid of books that have fallen out of fashion or no longer seem important enough. Now that the digital revolution has so lowered the cost of storage that libraries can at last do far better at this culture-building mission, a major publisher has instituted the nightmare culture-killing license.</p>

<p>So, why do I say that HarperCollins has lost its soul instead of just criticizing it for this action? Because if you cared about books as vehicles of ideas and not just vehicles of commerce, you would have dismissed with contempt an idea that treats them as evanescent as chatter on a call-in show.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wikipedia is looking for volunteers to answer some questions as they try to understand why researchers and experts do and do not contribute to Wikipedia. From the email they've sent around:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wikipedia is increasingly used by university students for "pre-research", to gain context and explore ideas for course assignments and research projects [1]. Yet many among scientists, academics and other experts are reluctant to contribute to Wikipedia, despite a growing number of calls from the scientific community to join the project [2–3].</p>

  <p>The Wikimedia Research Committee [4] has just launched a survey to understand why scientists, academics and other experts do (or do not) contribute to Wikipedia and other collaborative projects, and whether individual motivation aligns with shared perceptions of Wikipedia within expert communities. We hope this may help us identify ways around barriers to expert participation. The survey is anonymous and takes about 20 min to complete. Please help us circulate the link among your colleagues and collaborators:</p>

It's an exciting group, and we're proud that three of our projects made the list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>Library Analytics Toolkit</em>: Tools to enable libraries to understand, analyze, and visualize the patterns of activities, including checkouts, returns, and recent acquisitions, and to do so across multiple libraries.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>LibraryCloud Server</em>: Build and maintain a web server that makes available to all Harvard library innovators data and metadata gathered from the Harvard libraries.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Library Innovation Podcasts</em>: A series of biweekly podcast interviews with library innovators about their projects and ideas. The initial series would consist of 15 podcasts of about 20 minutes each.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We're very excited about these, and have already begun work on them. In fact, if you have ideas for people to interview for our podcasts, let us know.</p>

And a little more, from the first paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ISBN agency is virtually irrelevant to participants and most interviewees—including sophisticated players—do not understand or acknowledge important aspects of the ISBN standard. These aspects include the international community of ISBN countries, the ratification by ISO of the standard and important standard definitions contained in the standard. Many interviewees referred to the ISBN policies and procedures as "recommendations" or "best practices" and without correction each of these issues encourages misinterpretation of the ISBN standard policies.</p>

<p>It's so hard to know what things are when those things are made of information and are only things by analogy.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple months back on the airplane, I made a version of this list.  Some loose observations/questions about the Lab, what we've been focusing on, what we could be looking at…</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Measuring success</strong>—What constitutes a successful project?  What is our (LIL) metric?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Off-line innovation</strong>—We're focusing on software &amp; data, how can we expand our scope offline?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Voyeurism sells</strong>—Our most successful endeavors (as measured by eliciting a response [IMO]) have pulled back the curtain, allowing people to "see in" the library. People are curious, how can we leverage this voyeurism to make great projects?</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>See our assets with fresh eyes</strong>—Libraries have several amazing assets to leverage for innovation (that start-ups could only dream of):
 <br />
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><em>central location</em>—public libraries, private ones, academic - libraries are always sited at the heart of everything</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><em>librarians</em>—an interested community, a live and in-person customer support staff</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><em>strong user base</em>—a community of patrons</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><em>transaction data</em>—we can still identify trends, learn about the community while respecting privacy</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><em>trust</em>—people trust libraries and librarians as purveyors</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><em>inventory</em>—stuff (books, dvds, mags, kindles?) people want, for "free trial"</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The Library experience</strong>—Libraries, in general, have looked the same for quite a while.  The experience visiting a library, the services provided, the look hasn't changed too much.  What would the most far-out, radical library be?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Future</strong>—The future of the library is not the future of the book.  But how is it not?</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>A culture of innovation</strong>—How can we, as a Lab, both advance large projects, while also pursuing smaller ideas and experiments?</li>
</ol>

  <p><a href="http://infojustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/creative_commons2.jpg"><img src="http://infojustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/creative_commons2-300x113.jpg" alt="" /></a>The Brazilian Ministry of Culture has removed the logo of the Creative Commons license from its <a href="http://www.cultura.gov.br/site/">website</a>. Since Gilberto Gil was ahead of the Ministry (2003-2008), all the content of the website has been licensed in Creative Commons.</p>

  <p>The removal has been interpreted by the Brazilian civil society as a sign of the Minister ´s inflexibility. The removal came right after the publicization of an <a href="http://culturadigital.br/cartaaberta/">open letter</a>, asking for the continuation of the policies that were adopted or were under discussion during the government of Lula. Minister Ana de Hollanda has <a href="../archives/713">criticized</a> the proposal for copyright reform, which would, among of things, introduce important exceptions and limitations in Brazilian law.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've been thinking about an idea that doesn't seem to be working yet.  But gonna throw it out here anyway.</p>

<p>It's this idea of an information journey.  Adding a narrative arc/time dimension to information discovery.</p>

<p><strong>Test Case</strong></p>

<p>My personal trajectory into learning about art and artists, from about 1998–2003. It's basically a revisionist-history of my on-ramp into an aspect of the topic (conceptual art). Is there something more communicated when one shares their steps along the way?  They path that get them to their present interest?  Embedded is just a preview, click the "<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;source=embed&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=200031529082036271554.0004990cbe7d2a64eca9a&amp;ll=36.315125,-37.96875&amp;spn=157.611936,316.054688&amp;z=2">finding art"</a> to try it:</p>

<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=19OzeRXBpLRCcLjnDbhv-Q-sObf8" width="640" height="480"></iframe>

<p>View <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;source=embed&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=200031529082036271554.0004990cbe7d2a64eca9a&amp;ll=24.846565,-38.671875&amp;spn=98.357445,149.414063&amp;z=2">Finding Art</a> in a larger map</p>

<p>I made the mockup with google's my maps.  Should it be on a map? dunno, could just be a timeline,  but having the ability to hang off content in bubbles seems nice.</p>

<p>The sole difference between this and an annotated bibliography, or listmania for that matter, is the time/progression dimension.</p>

<p>If these paths were shared and made public, the intersections between them could be neat.</p>

<p>Thoughts/feedback (all thoughts from anybody are welcome : )?</p>

On the other hand, the reporter, Gretchen Vogel, points out that while 53% said they had published at least one open access article, only 10% of papers are published in open access journals. What's holding them back from doing more open access publishing? About 40% said it was because there wasn't enough funding to cover the publication fees, and 30% said there weren't high-quality open access journals in their field.</p>

On the other hand, the reporter, Gretchen Vogel, points out that while 53% said they had published at least one open access article, only 10% of papers are published in open access journals. What's holding them back from doing more open access publishing? About 40% said it was because there wasn't enough funding to cover the publication fees, and 30% said there weren't high-quality open access journals in their field.</p>

<p>The data and analysis is supposed to become available this week at <a href="http://project-soap.eu/">The SOAP Project</a>. Unfortunately, the <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/331/6015/273.1.full.pdf?sid=b6898b0e-de8a-4976-ad49-3f23264e9c3c">Science Magazine article</a> covering the report is only available  to members of the AAAS or to those willing to pay $15 for 24 hours of access.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The library in Stony Stratford near Milton Keynes, England, urged its patrons to check out every book on the shelves as a way of proving to the local council that its collection and facilities provide a vital service to the community. Stony Stratford is one of many towns across the UK that are facing severe library closures as the Tory-LibDem coalition government recklessly slashes its transfer payments to local governments (while breaking their promise to rein in enormous bonuses at the banks, even the ones that are owned by the taxpayer).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let's just hope the local government doesn't look around the emptied library and think, "Yeah, great, I can really see how the new town road repair tool shed could fit in that corner labeled 'Classics,' and we could put the new town golf course's  pro shop over there by where the empty 'Science' shelves are…"</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An open set of people—"2 Librarians, A Mathematician, An Economist, a Computer Scientist, a Library developer and a chemist," according to the <a href="http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2011/01/08/launch-of-%E2%80%9Cprinciples-on-open-bibliographic-data%E2%80%9D-at-pmr-symposium/">blog post</a>—has been working on <a href="http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2011/01/08/launch-of-%E2%80%9Cprinciples-on-open-bibliographic-data%E2%80%9D-at-pmr-symposium/">principles for open bibliographic data</a>. They're going to launch it on January 17 at the <a href="http://www-pmr.ch.cam.ac.uk/wiki/Visions_of_a_%28Semantic%29_Molecular_Future">PMR Symposium</a>.</p>

<p>The four principles expounded in the statement are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>When publishing data make an explicit and robust license statement.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Use a recognized waiver or license that is appropriate for data.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>If you want your data to be effectively used and added to by others it should be open as defined by the Open Definition (http://opendefinition.org/) – in particular non-commercial and other restrictive clauses should not be used.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>We strongly recommend explicitly placing bibliographic data in the Public Domain via PDDL or CC0.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Some of our own projects have to wrestle with licensing issues, so it will be helpful to have these principles out and officially published. (Hat tip to <a href="http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/">Peter Suber</a>)</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>JISC released a toolkit to helps librarians share their catalog records.
http://www.jisc.ac.uk/news/stories/2010/02/podcast98librarycatalogue.aspx</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Six libraries in Cologne became the first German libraries to commit to OA for their bibliographic data.  The libraries used CC0 to assign more than 5.4 million records to the public domain.
http://www.hbz-nrw.de/projekte/linked_open_data/english_version/
http://www.hbz-nrw.de/dokumentencenter/presse/pm/datenfreigabe_engl</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Open Knowledge Foundation launched a working group on open bibliographic data.
http://blog.okfn.org/2010/03/03/new-working-group-on-open-bibliographic-data/</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>OCLC released a new draft policy on the use of WorldCat records and welcomes comments until May 20.
http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6725522.html?nid=2673&amp;source;=title&amp;rid;=17392268</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The CERN Library provided OA to its book catalog and assigned the data to the public domain.  The goal is to encourage copying and reuse.  Said Jens Vigen, Head of the CERN Library:  "Books should only be catalogued once."
http://gs-service-bookdata.web.cern.ch/gs-service-bookdata/announcement.html</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The University of Konstanz and Cambridge University libraries announced plans to provide bibliographic data under an open license.
http://blog.okfn.org/2010/10/05/new-open-bibliographic-data-from-konstanz-and-cambridge/</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The U of Tübingen provides OA to its bibliographic data, at least since May 2010.
http://wiki.bsz-bw.de/doku.php?id=v-team:daten:openaccess:tuub</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Open Knowledge Foundation gave us a preview of Bibliographica, its new open-source tool to gather and share semantically rich bibliographic information.
http://blog.okfn.org/2010/05/20/bibliographica-an-introduction/</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Library Thing launched OverCat, an OA index of bibliographic data second in size only to WorldCat.  OverCat data was collected from over 700 sources.
http://www.librarything.com/blogs/librarything/2010/06/announcing-overcat/</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>WorldCat upgraded its Digital Collection Gateway to libraries, museums, and archives to contribute digital resources and metadata.
http://www.oclc.org/us/en/news/releases/2010/201044.htm</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen (RWTH Aachen University) opened up its bibliographic data, using CC0 to assign them to the public domain.
http://www.bth.rwth-aachen.de/offbibdat.html</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>WorldCat announced that it now has 200 million bibliographic records.  OCLC is still in the process of rethinking the access or data-sharing policy for WorldCat records.
http://www.oclc.org/news/releases/2010/201047.htm</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The British Library made three million bibliographic records OA under the CC0 Public Domain Dedication Licence.  "This dataset consists of the entire British National Bibliography, describing new books published in the UK since 1950; this represents about 20% of the total BL catalogue, and we are working to add further releases."
http://openbiblio.net/2010/11/17/jisc-openbibliography-british-library-data-release/</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Soon after the British Library's release of open bibliographic data (previous item), the JISC Open Bibliography project announced two ways in which it had made the data more useful.  "The data has been loaded into a Virtuoso store that is queriable through the SPARQL Endpoint and the URIs that we have assigned each record use the ORDF software to make them dereferencable, supporting perform content auto-negotiation as well as embedding RDFa in the HTML representation."
http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/open-bibliography/2010-November/000629.html</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>He also points to two out of chrono order (an artifact of the email back-and-forth that occasioned his sharing the list with us):</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The Open Knowledge Foundation Working Group on Open Bibliographic Data released a draft version of Principles on Open Bibliographic Data for public comment.
http://openbiblio.net/2010/10/15/principles-for-open-bibliographic-data/</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>JISC released the Open Bibliographic Data Guide for institutions providing OA to library catalogue records. The guide offers advice on how to license data, legal issues to be considered, and potential costs and savings.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is an olde post, that I'm coming back to, and adding onto.  Two interesting uses of twitter:</p>

<p><strong>1)  Twitter as Subject Stream:</strong> Over on techcrunch there's a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/09/why-is-quora-mass-creating-twitter-accounts-on-mechanical-turk/">post</a> about how <a href="http://www.quora.com/">Quora</a> is using Mechanical Turk to automate the creation of twitter accounts.  Quora is a mass  Q &amp; A website for anything.  You ask a question: "Where's the best  place to crowdsource an icon?", and you get a response, for example from user alton  sun :"<a href="http://99designs.com/">99designs.com….</a>".</p>

<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/09/why-is-quora-mass-creating-twitter-accounts-on-mechanical-turk/"><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2010/11/Picture-202.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Quora the site is organized into many subject areas which you can subscribe to (UI, Startups etc.).  They are creating a twitter account for each of these subject areas, so those interested Quora users can subscribe to the feed and get the newest message from that subject area.  It's cool.</p>

<p><strong>2) Twitter with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highpass_filter">High-Pass Filter</a>:</strong> This is the newer part of the post, <a href="http://about.me/jeffmiller">Jeff Miller</a>, has created a twitter feed that broadcasts Hacker News stories when they reach a certain point value.  <a href="http://twitter.com/newsyc100">http://twitter.com/newsyc100</a> was the first one I noticed, it broadcasts stories once they reach 100pts.  But it seems he also set a feed with 2opt, 50pt and 150pt triggers.  I really like the idea that once something has reached a level of community interesting-ness—as manifest in points—you can grant Hacker News the ability to become a verb and reach out and tell YOU about it.</p>

<p>You can decide that anything that is of <em>n</em> interestesting-ness to a community is of interest to me.</p>

<p>Why don't we all do that? In part it's because for many libraries, the provenance of the information in their bibliographic records cannot be known with certainty and may well include information received under licenses that forbid re-publication. It's a knotty, irksome problem.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.salon.com/technology/dan_gillmor/story/index.html?story=/tech/dan_gillmor/2010/11/05/archiving_ourselves">Dan Gillmor has a good post at Salon</a> about archiving the Net, spurred by meetings at the Library of Congress. I'm especially interested in his comments—pointing to <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2010/11/03/meetingAtLibraryOfCongress.html">a post by Dave Winer</a>—about the role of long-lived institutions, including universities.</p>

<p>Have we all concluded at this point that there is no hope of keeping a full and accurate archive? The Net is too vast, too every-changing, too complexly linked. I can't even keep a full archive of my own computer; the Mac's TimeMachine makes hourly backups, but not minutely or secondly, and it only preserves daily backups over the long-ish haul. All records are broken to one degree or another, because records require choices about what's worth recording and energy to do the recording. "Full record" is an oxymoron.</p>

<p>So the question is, what is the right periodicity and scope of the Internet record we want? Usually, questions about archives and records are relative to some use case. A general record of the Net is like a general record of life. So, we'll just have to make some choices that inevitably will turn out to be wrong for some unanticipated uses. We'll have to deal with it.</p>

<p>Personally, I'm heartened to see this discussion occurring at an institution with the gravitas of the Library of Congress, and that it includes people like Dan and Dave.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apps are everywhere. E-books are shifting from e-readers to apps as the platform of choice. Google's Android Market has surpassed 100,000 apps despite a problematic payment structure. And Apple, with its upcoming release of Mac OS X Lion, is moving apps from the device to the desktop.</p>

<p>Here in the lab, we've talked app development, but with little traction. Why no squealing tires, no fire? Why does spending even a little of our resources on app development feel so wrong? I don't know. But, it takes only a mention of HTML5 to uncover bubbling excitement at the possibilities and to discover we've already begun expending resources.</p>

<p>Apps are not here. I wonder what we're missing? Are apps a dead-end? of limited utility to academia? Is HTML the better technology for delivery to devices?</p>

]]></description>
        
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Hacker News</strong></p>

<p>Folks at the Lab have heard me talk about Hacker News.  I love it.  You may already know about it.  If not, it's a social news bulletin board: <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">news.ycombinator.com</a></p>

<p>The news is start-up, tech, or internet related (or otherwise compelling).  Good stories get voted up, and over time, gradually fade to the background. The ranking algorithm is explained here: <a href="http://amix.dk/blog/post/19574">http://amix.dk/blog/post/19574</a></p>

<p>In practice, what HN is is a large group (thousands) of really smart people, that become your extended curators/editors of all things web.  They crawl all the corners of its corners and post what they think the community would find interesting.  The thing that really sets it apart though is the quality—this is a really smart crowd.  What gets voted up, is worthy.  The comments are very good too.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2010/10/Screen-shot-2010-10-22-at-6.52.47-PM.png" alt="" />
Simple, information rich presentation</p>

<p><strong>Hacker Monthly</strong></p>

<p>Okay, so one thing that HN spawned/inspired was <a href="http://www.magcloud.com/browse/Magazine/79699">Hacker Monthly</a>. Their model is super simple:  "Every month, we select the top voted articles from Hacker News and put them in the magazine format." And printing is handled on-demand by Mag Cloud.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2010/10/Screen-shot-2010-10-22-at-7.00.34-PM1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Don't know if it's a business or what, but it's kinda profound:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A compelling magazine</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>crowd-edited</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>printed on-demand</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://hackermonthly.posterous.com/on-designing-hacker-monthly">designed</a>, "edited", put together by 1 person, the hatcher of the idea</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Hacker Books</strong></p>

<p>Now somebody's (<a href="http://www.whattofix.com/blog/archives/2010/10/top-dozen-hacke.php">Daniel B Markham</a>)  just come out with Hacker Books. <a href="http://www.hn-books.com/">www.hn-books.com</a></p>

<p>It's a list of all the books recommended by hackers to other hackers on Hacker News.  But also with the caveat that those recommended texts had to themselves get voted up by other readers.  So again, it is the community providing the editorial intelligence.  And its a compelling list of books.</p>

<p><strong>Fallout</strong></p>

<p>Both Hacker Monthly and Hacker Books are pure fallout of the vibrant Hacker News community.  They are also really interesting examples of how communities and publishing (and published) can interact.</p>

<p>Should we start a Hacker News for reference librarians/tech folk/book enthusiasts – start mining library intelligence?</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Barnes &amp; Noble has launched <a href="http://pubit.barnesandnoble.com/pubit_app/bn?t=pi_reg_home">PubIt</a>, a service for authors who want to publish directly to readers—well, directly through B&amp;N. Create a B&amp;N user account and upload some files, and PubIt will convert them to ePub, list your book on its site, collect money from sales, and about 60 days later will send you your money.</p>

<p>Some miscellaneous <a href="http://pubit.barnesandnoble.com/pubit_app/bn?t=support#pricing_payment_terms">points</a> about PubIt: You can optionally add DRM to your books, but you don't have to. You don't need an ISBN number. You set the list price, but B&amp;N can set the sale price. You have to charge at least $0.99. You have to guarantee that you won't list it for less elsewhere.</p>

<p>How much does an author make per copy? B&amp;N <a href="http://pubit.barnesandnoble.com/pubit_app/bn?t=support#pricing_payment_terms">says</a>: 65% of the list price for books priced at $2.99-$9.99, and 40% for books outside of that range. But a warning: I think I got that right, but B&amp;N refers to the money paid to "the Publisher," leaving us to figure out whether the publisher is the author or B&amp;N  It's getting so hard to tell!</p>

<p>(BTW, you can still buy <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/My-Hundred-Million-Dollar-Secret/David-Weinberger/e/9781847288004/?itm=1&amp;USRI=my+hundred+million+dollar+secret">books</a> published at <a href="http://www.lulu.com">LuLu.com</a> at B&amp;N.)</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I feel waves of evilness from big tech companies.</p>

<p>I've <em>never</em> felt evilness from a library.   Never even occurred to me.  They've been nothing but good to me.  Welcoming, safe—yes.  Evil?  No.</p>

<p>I trust libraries and it's well earned—they've spent decades defending privacy (primarily, I think, by not keeping records).  But could libraries begin to keep records, applying that same diligence and upholding of values?</p>

<p>I'd much sooner entrust a library with my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_graph">social graph</a> than I would Facebook.</p>

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/15142335">The Future of the Book.</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/ideo">IDEO</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

<p>Here's an article about it:</p>

<p>http://www.fastcodesign.com/1662356/ideo-creates-three-visions-for-books-in-the-digital-age?partner=co_newsletter</p>

<p>It's interesting, IDEO is obviously very on it.  I don't think there is anything that is absolutely relevant to us, but it is worth viewing.</p>

<p>What it does make me think of is the necessity to begin really trying to work out "The Future of Libraries".</p>

<p>I think we as a Lab need to define our mission in the context of a vision of the future.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the weekend, my wife's mom, Emily, set aside <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/sep/30/save-warburg-library/">this awesome article from the New York Review of Books</a>. Go Emily!</p>

<p>Written by Anthony Grafton and Jeffrey Hamburger, it is titled "Save the Warburg Library!".  In it, they explain the crisis the Warburg is in financially (hence the title).  But more importantly, they describe what makes this Art History library so unique—the cataloging scheme.  The stacks are open, and the juxtaposition of books "will bring the reader not only to the books he or she is looking for, but also to their unexpected 'good neighbours'."</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/sep/30/save-warburg-library/">http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/sep/30/save-warburg-library/</a></p>

<p>From the Warburg Institute Library's <a href="http://warburg.sas.ac.uk/mnemosyne/entrance.htm">web site</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The 350,000 or so volumes are classified in four sections: socia and political history (fourth floor); religion, history of science and philosophy (third and fourth floors); literature, books, libraries and education (second floor and basement); history of art (first floor, with classical art and archaeology in the basement). There are c. 2,500 runs of periodicals, about half of them current (mobile stacks in the basement). Readers have free access to the Library Holdings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Needless to say, this is very different from how the Library of Congress organizes things.  But who's to say that the LC system is better?  Different researchers have different needs, so this begs the question: <em>Can we make Harvard's collection "look" like the Warburg's?</em></p>

<p>I've been looking into visualizations book collections, so what if we rendered a shelf of virtual books based on the Warburg logic?  Or Princeton Univerity's Richardson system which groups all the books by each author together?</p>

<p>What are the benefits to our library singing Karaoke?</p>

<p><a href="http://howbigreally.com/">http://howbigreally.com/</a> (and great name too)</p>

<p>It reminds me of Sherman Williams' logo, which is a truth:</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2010/09/sherwin-williams-logo-paint1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I think communicating the profound scale of collections, and the human hours that go into creating it, could be useful.  Perhaps it would help better communicate the respect which libraries are perhaps due.</p>

<p><em>How many linear miles is Harvard's Collection?</em></p>

<p><em>How man human years have gone into cataloging all of its records?</em></p>

<p>I'd like to wrangle these.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Sorry. A week late with these staff meeting notes :( (Still not sure there's value in posting them, but that's not why there was a delay.)</em></p>

<p>We're going to look at the <a href="http://trove.nla.gov.au/">Australian</a> national Trove system for metadata standards.</p>

<p>The new Web server is up.</p>

<p>We are working on getting data from Cognos more directly and usefully.</p>

<p>We are continuing to look for a contract developer to help with some legacy projects that are important but are distracting us from tasks more in line with Lil's mission.</p>

<p>We are working with the Harvard Coop to get a list of books ordered for courses.</p>

<p>We are pretty consistently working with Harvard information systems that were not designed for sharing data across departments. People are being very helpful. But we should be documenting this process because other schools are facing the same issues.  We're going to set up a meeting with one of the main info shops in the school to see how we can collaborate on this.</p>

<p>We are beginning to investigate doing a book locator that shows books in physical maps of a library. This requires numbering the stacks physically. We talked about which library to start with.</p>

<p>StackView is looking at how to visualize multiple subject neighborhoods.</p>

<p>We are continuing to investigate real time notification systems.</p>

<p>We reported on our meeting with Jim Neal, University Librarian of Columbia University, in which we talked about ShelfLife, LibraryCloud, and the possibilities of collaboration.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Oxford English Dictionary has <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/7970391/Oxford-English-Dictionary-will-not-be-printed-again.html">announced</a> that it will not print new editions on paper. Instead, there will be Web access and mobile apps.</p>

<p>According to the article in the Telegraph, "A team of 80 lexicographers has been working on the third edition of the OED—known as OED3—for the past 21 years."</p>

<p>The trajectory toward digitization has been long for the OED. In the 1990s, the OED's desire to produce a digital version (remember books on CD?) stimulated search engine innovation. To search the OED intelligently, the search engine would have to understand the structure of entries, so that it could distinguish the use of a word as that which is being defined, the use of it within a definition, the use of it within an illustrative quote, etc. SGML was perfect for this type of structure, and the <a href="http://www.opentext.com">Open Text</a> SGML search engine came out of that research.   On the other hand, initially, the OED didn't want to attribute the origins of the word "blog" to Peter Merholz because he coined it in his own blog, and <a href="http://www.peterme.com/archives/00000222.html">the OED would only accept print attributions</a>. (See <a href="http://www.bradlands.com/weblog/comments/birth_of_blog/">here</a>, too.) It got over this prejudice for printed sources, however, and gave Peter proper credit.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This morning we had a very productive conference call (yes, there are such things, you cynics!) with Steve Midgley about the federal <a href="http://www.learningregistry.org">Learning Registry</a>.</p>

<p>The Learning Registry is a new project coming out of the Dept. of Education and the Defense Department, intended to provide easier, smarter access to federal content and beyond. The LR will list sources and provide ways to subscribe to metadata about the content at those sources. (There's more in<a href="http://www.ed.gov/blog/2010/07/the-learning-registry-a-first-look-2"> this blog post</a>.)</p>

<p>We'd like to be involved in some way because  (i) the LR might provide a transport/notification/subscription mechanism for those who want to use the metadata that  Library Lab apps will be making available (even though the LR is apparently designed only to give access to metadata about federal content); (ii) the LR may enable our apps to subscribe to metadata from many other sources; (iii) we'd like to help the LR accommodate the needs and gifts of research libraries.</p>

<p>So, we'll be talking more with Steve and the Learning Registry.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Notes from yesterday's weekly status update meeting:</p>

<p>Paul has loaded 12M records into a relational database, an important step toward putting ShelfLife onto a firm foundation and giving it the ability to assess relevancy  by looking at the entire data set. We're looking into how to make this a generalizable process. In parallel, Ben has started  development of a rudimentary API (right now, "version" and "search"), exploring what is needed.</p>

<p>We're looking at scripts to further automate accessing and extracting circulation data.</p>

<p>Annie is making progress on clustering works by the uniform title field, as well as some other data.This allows ShelfLife to present the reader with all (well, most) of the versions and editions of a book.</p>

<p>We're looking at additional sources od usage data.</p>

<p>We're starting to plan how to do focus groups for SL.</p>

<p>We're talking with an in-house statistician about how to do relevancy ranking better.</p>

<p>Jeff is wire-framing a way of zooming out of StackView to show more book context.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've read two articles by an editor over at O'reilly, <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/mikel/">Mike Loukides</a> that I've liked a lot.  What's cool is they offer a layperson's intro to data topics, but then quickly accelerate to specifics, practicalities and examples.</p>

<p>The first is "What is Data Science?": <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/06/what-is-data-science.html">http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/06/what-is-data-science.html</a></p>

<p>The second is "Data as a service": <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/07/data-as-a-service.html">http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/07/data-as-a-service.html</a></p>

<p>In this second story, he talks about visualization.  There clearly has been an explosion of info visualization out on the web.  Much much of it unremarkable.  But he cites a super beautiful example that Ben Fry and company did for GE about aging: <a href="http://www.ge.com/visualization/aging/">http://www.ge.com/visualization/aging/</a></p>

<p>Annie Jo pointed out that it's a Java Applet.  Slide that bar back and forth on the bottom and watch how SMOOOTH it is…..</p>

<p>I've posted a bit about this new job over at <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/2010/08/20/my-new-job/">my personal blog</a>.</p>

<p>I've been working with the Lab as a consultant for quite a while now, and with Kim and the team, for whom I have the highest regard, so this is not a big change for the Lab. But it is a very happy change for me.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With a precision that we can only assume they are winking at, <a href="http://booksearch.blogspot.com/2010/08/books-of-world-stand-up-and-be-counted.html">Google has announced</a> that there are 129,864,880 different books in the world.</p>

<p>The post, by Leonid Taycher, explains some of the decisions Google made when deciding what constitutes a book, but there are obviously cans of worms by the truckload waiting to be opened if someone really wanted to pin this number down. Or, put differently, there is no conceivable way of pinning this number down because books are too important and too ancient to be capable of anything except arbitrary definitions.  Google does it in part by making one-at-a-time human decisions: "Twice every week we group all those records into 'tome' clusters, taking into account nearly all attributes of each record." It's dirty work, but someone has to do it.</p>

<p>Actually, it's dirty, messy work that would seem perfectly suited to an expert-amateur collaboration: Librarians and readers. For example, just think how valuable it would be to know that two books were <em>almost</em> considered to be the same! Not to mention all the other relations among books that we could together could discover and publish.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://gillin.com/blog/2010/07/content-curation-on-steroids/">Paul Gillin blogs</a> about <a href="http://www.cithread.com/site/node">CIThread</a> (while disclosing that he is advising them):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The curator starts by presenting the engine with a basic set of keywords. CIThread scours the Web for relevant content, much like a search engine does. Then the curator combs through the results to make decisions about what to publish, what to promote and what to throw away.</p>

  <p>As those decisions are made, the engine analyzes the content to identify patterns. It then applies that learning to delivering a better quality of source content. Connections to popular content management systems make it possible to automatically publish content to a website and even syndicate it to Twitter and Facebook without leaving the CIThread dashboard.</p>

  <p>There's intelligence on the front end, too. CIThread can also tie in to Web analytics engines to fold audience behavior into its decision-making. For example, it can analyze content that generates a lot of views or clicks and deliver more source material just like it to the curator. All of these factors can be weighted and varied via a dashboard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I haven't seen the software so I don't know anything about the actual implementation, but providing ever more clever computer assistance to human curators sounds like an inevitably useful path.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Lab promotes the development of projects in all areas of library activity and leverages the entrepreneurial aspirations of people throughout the library system and beyond. Proposals from faculty and students from anywhere in the university will also be welcomed and the Lab will encourage collaboration with projects being developed at MIT.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is great news, both in its practical import and as yet another sign of Harvard's desire to innovate to help make libraries more useful,  valuable, and relevant than ever. Thanks to the <a href="http://www.arcadiafund.org.uk/content/default.asp">Arcadia Fund</a> for supporting this. (Our own <a href="blogs.law.harvard.edu/palfrey/">John Palfrey</a> is one of the members of the new Library Lab. Yay!)</p>

<p>In other news, it looks like our little library lab is going to be changing its name 🙂</p>

They list them in alphabetical order:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Academic library collection growth is driven by patron demand and will include new resource types.</em></p>

  <p><em>Budget challenges will continue and libraries will evolve as a result.</em></p>

  <p><em>Changes in higher education will require that librarians possess diverse skill sets.</em></p>

  <p><em>Demands for accountability and assessment will increase.</em></p>

  <p><em>Digitization of unique library collections will increase and require a larger share of resources.</em></p>

  <p><em>Explosive growth of mobile devices and applications will drive new services.</em></p>

  <p><em>Increased collaboration will expand the role of the library within the institution and beyond.</em></p>

  <p><em>Libraries will continue to lead efforts to develop scholarly communication and intellectual property services</em></p>

  <p><em>Technology will continue to change services and required skills.</em></p>

  <p><em>The definition of the library will change as physical space is repurposed and virtual space expands.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hard to argue with anything on that list, beyond alphabetizing on the word "the" 🙂 Some of the items seem to bury the lede a bit, though. For example, access to digitized, full-text sources shows up at the end of the first point on the list. Under that same point, "the effect of Google Books on library collections" shows up at the end in a comma-separated list of "additional collection development trends."</p>

<p>One point that the Lab is particularly interested in that didn't make it explicitly onto the list:  The rise in value of library metadata. There's tons of it around. It can be of incredible and continuing use to anyone trying to find or understand items in (or linked to) collections of all sorts. Library metadata is going to be big! Big, we tell you!</p>

<p>The site is, let's say, very busy graphically, with a bunch of different ways to find what you want or browse to discover something good to listen to. But,  now SpokenWord is looking for volunteers to curate podcast feeds and episodes in topics that interest them. These curated collections will be the main feature at the SpokenWord site, because nothing knows what's interesting to humans better than other humans do. <a href="http://news.spokenword.org/rd/9z1zqcjgq8lkarlf8v2o6i2oqe27brprhd9pmgi7nco">Details here</a>.</p>

<p>It also reminded me of the <a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu/twitter/">Library Hose</a>.  Not because of Twitter (which is the broadcast channel for this), but because it was an idea that we did a while back and kinda shelved.  And now its coming back around into ShelfLife.</p>

<p><strong>Speed</strong> — it just has to work <em>fast</em></p>

<p><strong>Instant Utility</strong> —</p>

<p><strong>Voice</strong> — attitude, style, personality, you should feel like your consuming media (CNN, Fox News) when you're interacting</p>

<p><strong>Less Is More</strong> — Great services are simple.  Example: delicious (which drives our "what we're reading" section).  You can do very little but still be powerful.</p>

<p><strong>Programmable</strong> — APIs, read/write APIs, Absolutely essential to let others contribute functionality to your application.</p>

<p><strong>Personal</strong> — Avatars, Backgrounds, UGC, so people can feel ownership</p>

<p><strong>"RESTful"</strong> — Everything in the application has a url.  And the url has clean and understandable path.   This way the web can access your app in deep ways.  Build on an open architecture.</p>

<p><strong>Discoverable</strong> — Build from the ground up to be discoverable through google, but also through Social Media.  Build from the ground up to be viral.  So it can push itself.</p>

<p><strong>Clean</strong> — The app has to be simple visually, not busy on the page.  Lots of space.  Big fonts.  Not too much functionality per page.  Very inviting.  <a href="http://www.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> is a great example  you just know what to do.</p>

<p><strong>Playful</strong> — Have fun.  The ability to play in an application.  Foster a game dynamic.  Like Weight watchers, you establish goals, you get points and report against goals, you meet goals and are rewarded.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Saw a presentation yesterday from Dan Reetz who's behind the <a href="http://www.diybookscanner.org/">DIY Book Scanner Project</a>.</p>

<p>He made a real interesting comment which stuck with me.  Computers are going to be the ones reading the most books in the future.  (or something like that, apologies).</p>

<p>If computers will be the biggest readers (because of search), what would books written expressly for computers look like?  I'm not talking metadata, I'm thinking body text.  How should content be expressed to facilitate computer "understanding", or "satisfy" a computer readers.  Would it just be code?</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scribblenauts">Scribblenauts</a> is a Nintendo game.  The object is to solve a puzzle.  Say there's a kitten stuck in a tree.  If you type in 'ladder', the puzzle is solved.  If you type in 'jetpack' the puzzle is solved.</p>

<p>So it's definitely different than the rest.  It's innovative.  I'm still not sure exactly what makes it so cool, but I see connections with libraries and potential to somehow apply the cool factor.</p>

<p>I see the game play as a form of searching.  It sort of works the way most people assume or maybe just hope that search works.  Type in your word and the puzzle is solved.  There are many words that will work to solve the same puzzle.</p>

<p>The problem is that search doesn't work like this.  Especially in scholarly research.  There are multiple places to enter keywords.  The keywords that come to mind are often not the ones that will bring relevant results.  All relevant results do not share the same set of keywords.</p>

<p>The game was basically built by researching and recording each noun's metadata.  Librarians and indexers have done a lot of that work already, so why isn't our version working?</p>

        <title>Address Bar Grammar</title>
        <link>https://lil.law.harvard.edu/blog/2010/03/18/251/</link>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2010/03/grammar1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Address bar grammar kinda sucks. It doesn't even throw us the bone of intuitive legibility.  Let alone to the level of predictability.  It just goes for strict path data.  www.example.com/go_here/then_here/.
It doesn't allow you to shortcut GUI navigation with text entry if you know what you're doing.</p>

<p>One recent Carsonified post was particularly inspiring: <a href="http://carsonified.com/blog/dev/conversational-and-short-urls-on-rails/">Conversational and short URLs on Rails</a></p>

<p>It was written by Jason Lynes, from <a href="http://hulabalub.com/events/in/boston">www.hulabalub.com</a>.  Look at what he does.  He goes for more natural language links in the path by adding clear facet names and the inclusion of prepositions:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">events/in/chicago</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">events/on/design
meetups/on/entrepreneurship/in/san_francisco/with/fred_wilson</code></p>

<p>The introduction of prepositions is awesome.  There is one new thing for folks to learn, "_" is a space for spaced elements acting as one facet,  No big deal.</p>

<hr />

<p>Direct address address bar manipulation could be nice because it "upgrades" gracefully.  If you know what you're doing, you do it and
it's fast.  You do a "natural language" keystroke search in the address bar.  If you don't, you fall back on the website's navigation.</p>

<hr />

<p>I'm curious about taking it a little further.  Usually, headings are followed by attribution info.  So what about if we tried to emulate this by enlisting the help of subdomains, instead of paths?   Let's forget about backend inefficiency for the moment.  What if your homepage is: <code class="highlighter-rouge">home.example.com</code>?  Your "about" page is named <code class="highlighter-rouge">about.example.com</code>?  And on top of that, <code class="highlighter-rouge">aboutpage.example.com</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">about_page.example.com</code> too (so if someone's trying to guess it we'll try and predict mistakes)?  BTW, we'll also have normal GUI navigation as the catch condition.</p>

<p>Can the subdomain act more like a natural language search field?  Could you put <code class="highlighter-rouge">phone.example.com</code>, or <code class="highlighter-rouge">phonenumber.example.com</code>, or
<code class="highlighter-rouge">map.example.com</code> to directly display the map element, or phone number?</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is definitely a half baked observation of a "pain point".</p>

<p>I was snapping some images from the web, with both the "Snag-It" tool and right-click Save As.</p>

<p>These were JPEGs</p>

<p>But I wanted to cite, within the image, where I got it from on the greater web.  I wanted to keep the provenance.  I wanted to add metadata to this thing, not create some tiny TXT file to write out the data and sit it next to.</p>

<p>I couldn't think of a tool to add personally relevant metadata to non text files, that I could view on my machine.  Notes for me.   (And there are a lot of practical issues about why this is the case, but…)</p>

<p>Why is it my perception that metadata authorship only for the realm of experts?</p>

<p>(excluding websites that support tagging)</p>

<p>…And granted this is probably a nearly Operating System level issue, but it may tie into Ben's observations about packaging metadata.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Posted to the ASIS-L list by Susan Emilie Manus of the LOC:</p>

<p>The <a href="http://digitizationguidelines.gov">Federal Agencies Digitization Guidelines Initiative</a> (FADGI) has just released a new planning document, <a href="http://www.digitizationguidelines.gov/stillimages/documents/Planning.html"><em>Digitization Activities: Project Planning and Management Outline</em></a>.</p>

<p>The aim of this document is to define activities relating to the digitization of original cultural materials, and to outline general steps for planning and management of this process. The activities described in this document address library/archival issues, imaging and conversion work, and IT infrastructure issues in particular, and were identified using project management outlines from several organizations with significant experience working with cultural materials. This document defines "digitization" as a complete process, and covers all project components from content selection through delivery of digitized objects into a repository environment.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the emergence of large scale multi-touch screens we may be able to create a life-size digital bookshelf.  See the following pointers:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.perceptivepixel.com">Perceptive Pixel (Jeff Han's company)</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/jeff_han_demos_his_breakthrough_touchscreen.html">The Jeff Han TED presentation</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/">Microsoft's Surface site</a></li>

<p>Imagine a 4ft x 6ft screen which renders a bookshelf, but a bookshelf augmented with faceted search, re-organization, etc. essentially allowing the books on the shelf to re-organize themselves and the ability to "grab" the books for later viewing on-line or desk pick-up.  Another benefit is that the shelf could be made to work with a very large catalog of publications and not be limited by its physical size.</p>
