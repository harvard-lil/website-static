The new service would be called CURIOSity, and, as Wendy notes, it does not exist yet.</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>NOTE: Live-blogging.</strong> Getting things wrong. Missing points. Omitting key information. Introducing artificial choppiness. Over-emphasizing small matters. Paraphrasing badly. Not running a spellpchecker. Mangling other people's ideas and words. You are <em>warned</em>, people.</p> <p>The name comes from "cabinets of curiosities" [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_curiosities">Wunderkammern</a>], which were forerunners of modern museums. It also comes from "curios" as treasures.</p> <p>CURIOSity is designed to enable the creation of web-based collection presentations and exhibits: to make an entire collection accessible through searching and browsing; to highlight a collection (or collections) through an exhibition of a limited number of things; to share a research project; or as a resource for a course. Features that users expect to see include: searching and browsing; refining results through faceting, descriptive text and thumbnails; narrative context and graphics. Additional desired features might include: geographic display of collections on a map, chronological display on a timeline; or user contributed data like annotations or tags. E.g., Stanford's <a href="http://bassiveratti.stanford.edu/">Bassi-Veratti Collection</a>; <a href="http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/">the Shelley-Godwin Archive</a>; and the <a href="http://www.edickenson.org">Emily Dickinson</a> collection. These are great collections, but they were not easy to create. Wouldn't it help to have services that make it easier? Wendy points to the <a href="https://wiki.harvard.edu/confluence/display/HLSLibraryInteroperability/Collection+and+Exhibition+Platforms">Interoperability wiki</a> where the original notes about the proposal and key requirements are posted.</p> <p>Based on the discussion at the meeting it is unlikely that a single software solution will solve all the needs, though each requires platform requires different skill sets. The group began by looking at <a href="http://www.Omeka.org">Omeka</a>, <a href="http://www.simile-widgets.org/exhibit3/">Exhibit 3</a>, and <a href="http://projectblacklight.org/">Blacklight</a>. Now they're also looking at <a href="http://www.shared-canvas.org/">Shared Canvas</a>. We can't rely on having resources at hand for doing the required coding and metadata wrangling (converting from native formats). So, maybe we should have a sandbox for experimenting. Then Library Technical Services could provide software hosting.</p> <p>The CURIOSity program could also evaluate new software packages and provide analyses and feature comparisons.</p> <p>CURIOSity could provide integration services. It could harvest metadata, link to content in <a href="http://hul.harvard.edu/ois/systems/drs/">DRS</a>, and provide tools and APIs.</p> <p>Who would do the work? You need programmers and admins to set up the platform. We'd want to customize it to integrate it with Harvard info. E.g., we [the Interoperability Initiative] did a plugin for Omeka so that it can use distributed sources. Each collection needs to be customized. We could create designs specific to a department. For each collection, a curator has to manage the content, rights clearances, etc. There's a lot of work, and this would take more than LTS!</p> <h2 id="qa-and-discussion">Q&amp;A; and Discussion</h2> <p>Q: A lot of it is about design. That's half of how we spend our time.</p> <p>Q: Aesthetics are expensive and change.</p> <p>Q: How long do we expect these collections to live?</p> <p>Q: There needs to be an easy way to get your metadata out.</p> <p>Q: The metadata should be sustainable.</p> <p>Q: What would be the first collection building software to support?</p> <p>A: Probably Omeka, and we're looking at the <a href="http://library.stanford.edu/blogs/digital-library-blog/2014/02/stanford-begins-development-spotlight">Spotlight</a> plugin for Blacklight that makes it easier to use.</p> </div> <footer> <span class="tag"><a href="/blog/tag/collections">collections</a></span> <span class="category"><a href="/blog/category/curation">curation</a></span> <span class="category"><a href="/blog/category/interop">interop</a></span> <span class="category"><a href="/blog/category/library-cloud">Library Cloud</a></span> </footer> </article> </div> </section> <footer> <div class="sleeve"> <figure class="footer-logo"> <img src="/assets/thumbs/351x143r/lab-logo-footer-home.png" srcset="/assets/thumbs/351x143r/lab-logo-footer-home.png, /assets/thumbs/702x286r/lab-logo-footer-home.png 2x" alt="Library Innovation Lab" class="img-full-width"> </figure> <ul> <li><a href="/">Home</a></li> <li><a href="/about/">About</a></li> <li><a href="/projects/">Projects</a></li> <li><a href="/sketches/">Sketches</a></li> <li><a href="/blog/">Blog</a></li> </ul> <div class="footer-copyright"> <p>&copy;2017 The President and Fellows of Harvard University</p> <p>The content on this site is covered under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license unless otherwise noted.</p> </div> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
