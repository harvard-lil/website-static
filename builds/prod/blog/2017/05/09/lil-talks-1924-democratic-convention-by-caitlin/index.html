Immigrants from Africa and Asia were outright banned.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Ku Klux Klan was at its peak with an estimated 3–8 million members.

A 2/3 vote was needed to select a candidate and in order to accomplish that the convention lasted for 16 days and 103 ballots until a consensus was reached. The convention was PACKED and the Washington Post described it as full of “Tammany shouters, Yiddish chanters, vaudeville performers, saga Indians, hulu dancers, street cleaners, firemen, policemen, movie actors &amp; actresses, bootleggers, 1,098 delegates and 15 presidential candidates.”</p> <p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen-Shot-2017-05-08-at-5.03.09-PM.png" alt=""> <em>Underwood &amp; Underwood.
