The Fellowship is intended to serve as a launching pad for a creative, entrepreneurial, and technically savvy law graduate or lawyer who intends to pursue a career in technology innovation and the law.</p> <p>The Fellowship is co-sponsored by two Law School programs&mdash;the <a href="/">Library Innovation Lab</a> and <a href="http://www.developingjustice.org/">Developing Justice@HLS</a>&mdash;that together serve as incubators for innovative ideas designed to improve the law, access to the law, and access to justice. The project proposed by the Fellow should clearly further the mission of the Library Innovation Lab or Developing Justice or both.</p> <p>During the Fellowship year, the Fellow will identify a discrete problem in the legal field and design, prototype and iterate on a technology-enabled solution. The Fellow's work throughout the year will reflect a bias in favor of action and experimentation, emphasizing committed code over planning, analysis and discussion. The Fellow will be embedded with the lawyers and programmers within the Library Innovation Lab and Developing Justice. And while the Fellow will be expected to do his or her own technical work, the opportunity promises active collaboration with, and feedback from, this community of fellow travelers.</p> </div> </div> <div class="slice"> <h2>About the Library Innovation Lab</h2> <div class="slice-body"> <p>The <a href="/">Lab</a> is a multidisciplinary team of lawyers, programmers, librarians and designers based in the Harvard Law School Library. Its work explores opportunities and challenges at the intersection of libraries, technology and law. Its recent efforts have focused on large technical initiatives like the <a href="/projects/caselaw-access-project/">Caselaw Access Project</a>, <a href="/projects/perma-cc/">Perma.cc</a>, <a href="/projects/h2o/">H2O</a> and the <a href="/projects/nuremberg-project/">Nuremberg Trials Project</a>, as well as smaller explorations like <a href="/sketches/local-memory/">Local Memory</a> and <a href="/projects/time-capsule-encryption/">Time Capsule Encryption</a>.</p> </div> </div> <div class="slice"> <h2>About Developing Justice</h2> <div class="slice-body"> <p><a href="http://www.developingjustice.org/">DJ@HLS</a> is a technology initiative embedded within the clinical program of Harvard Law School. Using the Law School's 18 in-house clinics and 11 student practice organizations as sites for experimentation, we use technology to foster innovation and promote access to justice. We collaborate with clinical faculty, instructors, students and partners to develop, test, and deploy new ideas and technology tools. Among our numerous projects, we have built technology to monitor important government websites, to expedite the discover process in litigation, and to expand access to eligibility information for a critical safety net program.</p> </div> </div> <div class="slice"> <h2>Terms of the Fellowship</h2> <div class="slice-body"> <p>The successful candidate will receive a one-year appointment as a fellow in residence at Harvard Law School, which appointment includes salary, healthcare benefits, office space, a computer with a suite of software development tools, and access to other Law School and University resources and amenities.</p> </div> </div> <div class="slice"> <h2>Applying</h2> <div class="slice-body"> <p>Applications will be considered on a rolling basis.
