        <p><strong>Applications for the Harvard Library Innovation Lab Summer Fellows Program for 2016 are now closed. To learn about future opportunities, please <a href="https://harvard.us7.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=d69d9fa13a9f7b51b8f939df4&amp;id=29b80c6b9d">sign up for our mailing list</a>.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Call for Summer 2016 Fellows</strong></p>

        <p>The Harvard Library Innovation Lab is seeking thinkers and doers to join our Summer 2016 class of fellows.</p>

        <p>Our summer fellows program will bring together a small set of visionaries to explore future directions in libraries, law, and technology. We value different ways of thinking and strongly encourage brilliant minds from all disciplines and backgrounds to apply.</p>

        <p><strong>The Program</strong></p>

        <p>A cohort of three fellows will join the Lab in June, 2016 and will stay through the end of August, 2016. Fellows will enter the program with their own projects and will collaborate with their cohort and members of the Lab to produce paradigm shifting research, design, code, and art.</span></p>

        <p>Energy from all corners of law, tech, and libraries is welcomed, with particular encouragement given to potential candidates that might benefit from some of the Lab's current work in <a href="/projects/perma-cc/">web archives</a>, <a href="/projects/caselaw-access-project/">open law</a>, <a href="/projects/time-capsule-encryption/">cryptography</a>, <a href="/projects/nuremberg-project/">war crimes research</a>, and <a href="/projects/h2o/">free textbooks</a>. All stages of education and career are welcome - from drifters to undergraduates to practicing artists to working professionals.</p>

        <p>Fellows will have access to working space in the Harvard Law School Library and will lead weekly research and project updates on Wednesdays. The structure over the twelve weeks will be largely shaped by the work of the fellows and the energy they contribute.</p>

        <p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>

        <p>The Lab is a gathering place for ideas. It brings together creative thinkers to solve problems, and has a culture that encourages a bias for action. We think and we do. The Lab's tendency to push individuals and groups toward meaningful work is the greatest benefit of the program.</p>

        <p>In addition to a rich environment, fellows will receive access to Harvard’s world class research libraries and collaboration opportunites with the staff, faculty, and researchers in the Lab and in the <a href="https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/">Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society</a>.</p>

        <p>Each fellow will receive a stipend of $6,000 that we hope will defray some of the housing, transportation, and child care costs that each fellow will incur.</p>

        <p><strong>Commitment to Diversity</strong></p>

        <p>The work and well-being of the Lab are strengthened profoundly by the diversity of our network and our differences in background, culture, experience, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, and much more. We actively seek and welcome applications from people of color, women, the LGBTQIA community, and persons with disabilities, as well as applications from researchers and practitioners from across the spectrum of disciplines and methods.</p>

        <p><strong>Apply</strong></p>

        <p>Our 2016 program is fast approaching. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis until April 27, 2016. To apply, submit the following to <a href="mailto:lil@law.harvard.edu?subject=Summer%20Fellows%20Application">lil@law.harvard.edu</a></p>

        <ul>
            <li>short cover letter</li>
            <li>resume or CV</li>
            <li>sample of prior or current work</li>
            <li>description of work you’ll pursue during the program</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>

        <p><em>Do I have to live in Cambridge, MA?</em></p>

        <p>All fellows are expected to be in Langdell Hall on Wednesdays and we hope fellows will collaborate in-person throughout the week. Close proximity collaboration is one of the central benefits of the program.</p>

        <p><em>Any insider tips on housing for the summer?</em></p>

        <p>Boston hosts tons of students that are not around during the summer. Ask your network and spend some time on <a href="http://boston.craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a> to get a feel for options.</p>

        <p><em>Just three fellows?</em></p>

        <p>The summer cohort will join our two current fellows, <a href="/about">Jack Cushman and Sarah Glassmeyer, in addition to the other members of the Lab</a>.</p>

        <p><em>What are the dates of the program?</em></p>

        <p>The program will start on June 2, 2016 and run through August 31, 2016. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis until April 27, 2016.</p>

        <p><em>Can I apply from outside the United States?</em></p>

        <p>Absolutely. A broad range of backgrounds and ways of thinking are highly valued.</p>

        <p><em>When do I hear from you? What is the timeframe for decisions?</em></p>

        <p>Applications are reviewed on a rolling basis until April 27, 2016. You will receive notice of acceptance before April 29, 2016.</p>
