        <p>Adam shared two different topics on February 24, 2017 — Mardi Gras and how to be deposed.</p>

<p>Adam grew up in New Orleans and it was clear from his talk that the gravity of MG still pulled on him.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/a3-768x495.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Adam reviewed the history of the yearly celebration and highlighted the fascinating tradition of the social orgs that fuel the celebration — the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krewe">krewes</a>.</p>

<p>The thing that stuck with me a week later as i reflect on Adam’s talk — Mardi Gras is different things to different people. For wild, party seeking, spring breakers, it’s one thing. And, for families that march as high school band members, and for community leaders (in and far away from the French Quarter) that network by shaking a ten thousand hands — it’s another thing.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/a1-768x542.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Hard Right Turn — It’s a two for one talk today!!</p>

<p>Adam also used his experience as a practicing litigator to instruct us on how to behave when being deposed. Fascinating!! Adam shared his guidelines — something like,  1/ tell the truth;  2/ take your time when responding to the question;  3/ only respond to the question by being focused in your response.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/a2-1-768x406.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We watched three entertaining and engrossing depositions — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISW3_KT5PeY">Joe Jamail</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_E_kKGvytk">Lil Wayne</a> (oh, I wish he had a library rhyme. please, please, please toss us a bone Lil wayne!!), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dqE9Ns-RJM">Donald Trump</a> — and enjoyed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_cake">king cake</a> and coffee!</p>

          <a href="/blog/2017/01/20/end-of-the-awesome-box-experiment/ ">Awesome Box was an Amazing Experiment. Thank you!</a></h2>
        
          
          <p class="post-author">Posted by <a href="/about/#matt-phillips">Matt Phillips</a></p>
        
      </header>

      <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>Awesome Box was a highly successful experiment that helped LIL explore new ways of enabling peer to peer reading recommendations in libraries.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/awesome_action.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The Awesome Box was <a href="https://github.com/harvard-lil/awesome/tree/master/django/static/images/box-images">a physical box</a> that a library would sit next to the library’s regular returns box and if you thought the book was mind blowing, you dropped it in the Awesome Box instead of the regular returns box. The librarian then has the option to scan the book into the Awesome Box website to enable digital sharing of lists of awesome items. Or, the librarian can keep things no-tech and put the item on a shelf labelled <em>Community Recommendations</em>.</p>

<p>Annie Cain and I created the Awesome Box after hearing about a similar idea functioning in a European library. In 2013, we developed the web app, received a little grant funding from <a href="https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/liblab/">Harvard’s Library Lab and the Arcadia Fund</a>, and started collaborating with libraries at Harvard, Somerville Public (first Awesome Box in the wild!!), Cambridge Public, and Brookline Public here in the Boston area.</p>

<p>Annie and I (with Annie doing the lion’s share) worked hard to develop the Awesome Box community by quickly replying with advice when emails arrived and talking about Awesome Box at several conferences and gatherings of librarians.</p>

<p>I learned a ton about product development and adoption with the Awesome Box, but two big things that stick out after much reflection — make the thing you’re building fit with the patterns of the folks that will use the thing (people are returning books anyway, they just need to choose a box), and you have to sell, sell, sell! Awesome Box is fun and free (<a href="https://github.com/harvard-lil/awesome">as in open source and as in no money</a>) and we still constantly talked it up and pushed it for three years. I’ve found that it’s hard to find success with a project if you just dump on the web and expect people to use it — you’ve got to wire people to your project.</p>

<p>Awesome Box is certainly one of the most successful projects I’ve been lucky enough to be part of. And, arguably, one of the most successful projects to roll out of LIL. Thank you so much to all the libraries that joined together to make Awesome Box so much fun! If you’re a library and you didn’t have a chance to export your Awesome items, please <a href="mailto:mphillips@law.harvard.edu">drop me an email</a> and I’ll get your data to you.</p>

<p>Awesome Box was an experiment. It’s done and the servers have been powered down. During it’s glorious run, the Awesome Box supported <strong>512 private, public, and academic libraries across the US</strong>. The members of those libraries dropped 104,715 items dropped in the Awesome Box from 2013 to 2016.</p>

<p>Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.</p>

      <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>I've been playing with physical pitch decks lately. Slides as printed cards.</p>

<p>PowerPoint, <a href="http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/">Deck.js</a>, and the like are fantastic when sharing with large groups of people — from a classroom full of folks to a web full of folks. But, what if easy and broad sharing isn't a criteria for your pitch deck?</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/12/pitch-med.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>You might end up with physical cards like I did when I recently pitched <a href="/blog/2016/09/02/private-talking-spaces-progress/">Private Talking Spaces</a>. The cards are surprisingly good!! Just like non-physical slides, they can provide outlines for talks and discussions, but they're so simple (just paper and ink), they won't get in the way when sharing ideas with small groups.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/12/IMG_7287.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The operation of the cards is as plain as can be - just take the card off the top, flip it upside down, and put it to the side. </p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/12/IMG_7289.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>n cards = n screens in the world of physical pitch decks. I wish we had multiple projectors in rooms! In the photo above, I pin my agenda card up top.</p>

<p>I drew the slides in Adobe Illustrator. They're six inches square and printed on sturdy paper. If you'd like to make your own, here's <a href="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/pts-pitch.ai">my .ai file</a> and here's <a href="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/pts-pitch.pdf">a .pdf version</a>.</p>

<p>It feels like there's something here. Some depth. If you've had success with physical pitch decks, please <a href="mailto:mphillips@law.harvard.edu">send me pointers</a>. Thanks!!</p>

<p>we hosted a bunch of amazing visitors earlier this week (knight prototype workshop!) and we were fortunate enough to gather everyone for dinner. after drinks were served, i used my phone's camera and swooped into each booth aka pocket of people.</p>

<p>swooping into these pockets of people is surprisingly meaningful and rich — i very much get a distinct sense for the vibe/mood/energy at each table. this swoop in and pan pattern is deep.</p>

<p>what should i do with these clips? feels like there's some coolness here but i can't seem to grab it. ideas?</p>

<p>The Nuremberg Tribunals Project is excited to announce the launch of its new <a href="http://nuremberg.law.harvard.edu">website</a>.</p>

<p>Our team at the Harvard Library Innovation Lab and the Harvard Law Library's Department of Historical and Special Collections has been working hard the past year to create a new, rich, flexible and visually appealing discovery and viewing experience for our 750,000-page Nuremberg Trials archive.  The archive materials comprise the full document record for all 13 Nuremberg Trials, held at Nuremberg 1945-49.  Of those, so far the project has been able to process the materials for 5 of the 13 trials and make them available online.  The documents include all trial exhibits, source materials from which most of the trial exhibits were selected, and the full day-to-day proceedings for each trial as recorded in the trial transcripts.  Also included are several hundred annotated photographs taken of the trial proceedings.</p>

<p><a href="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/11/HLSL-Nuremberg-Document-4430-page-1.jpg"><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/11/HLSL-Nuremberg-Document-4430-page-1.jpg" alt="hlsl-nuremberg-document-4430-page-1" /></a></p>

<p>The Harvard Nuremberg collection is one of the few comprehensive document sets available for these trials.  While many institutions possess materials relating to the International Military Tribunal, relatively few have significant archives relating to any or all of the follow-on 12 National Military Tribunals adjudicated by the United States.  Aside from the U.S. National Archives, Harvard is unique in offering access to the full set of materials generated by all 13 Nuremberg trials.</p>

<p>The new website replaces our previous online presence dating from 2003.  Its beautiful, elegantly functional design was created by Frances Duncan and implemented by Emma Cushman, whose open-source project code is available at <a href="https://github.com/harvard-lil/nuremberg">GitHub</a>.  It offers through its new design deep, faceted document and photograph search and full-text keyword transcript search.  Document page images are viewable at a variety of zoom levels, and the transcripts are rendered as both plain text and scanned page images.  All document and transcript page images and transcript full text are downloadable and printable.  The website also offers rich introductory materials to the subject matter of the Trials and document archive as well as detailed introductions to each trial, supporting our goal of making the site useful for the general public as well as researchers in the field.</p>

<p>The Project and website are profiled in the <a href="http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/10/devils-in-the-details/">Harvard Gazette</a>.</p>

<p>The Web project is a multi-year, multi-phase, on-going initiative.  We have completed the digitization work of scanning all the materials into digital format, have completed the conversion of a third of the transcripts into full-text searchable format, and have finished the analytical work of describing in detail the documents for 5 of the 13 trials.  We are actively pursuing outside funding to support expanding the exposure of this unique collection to the world in a fully open and accessible way.</p>

<p>The future of the lab — I saw <a href="http://www.ivanpoupyrev.com/">Ivan Poupyrev</a> talk about about the future of labs. He said a whole bunch of interesting things, but the thing stuck most with me is his advice on staffing a lab. He said something like "Bring in people that are focused on solving a problem. If they have a project you want to support and grow, bring them in and give them space to build that thing." Totally sold on this idea. Projects often need the stamina and focus of a single person (two people feels good too) to jam it through to success.</p>

        <p>We have a data management dilemma, and we hope that you — data-smart people of the world — can help us out. We need a versioning and change tracking system for around 50 million XML files, and no existing solutions seem to fit.</p>

<h2 id="about-the-project">About The Project</h2>

<p>The Caselaw Access Project or CAP, previously known as Free The Law, is making all U.S. case law freely accessible online. For more information, see  <a href="/projects/caselaw-access-project">our project page</a>, and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/29/us/harvard-law-library-sacrifices-a-trove-for-the-sake-of-a-free-database.html">this New York Times article</a>.</p>

<h2 id="our-tracking-task">Our Tracking Task</h2>

<p>Like most digitization projects, we generate many page images. The binary image files rarely change and are not difficult to track. However, in addition to images, we create rich XML files containing descriptive/structural metadata and OCR. As we uncover mistakes in the OCR, encounter metadata anomalies, and gather new data through CAP-facilitated research projects, we will need to update these files. Tracking those changes is going to be a bit more difficult.</p>

<h3 id="the-files">The Files</h3>

<p>We are scanning about 37,000 volumes. Each volume contains multiple pages (obviously) and multiple cases. Usually, a case takes up a few pages, but some cases are so small that several can fit on one page, so there's no direct parent/child relationship between them. Cases never span volumes.</p>

<p>If you're interested in checking out a case for yourself, you can grab a sample case with all the associated files <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0XytYvCOEw-YU41MWNyVEJfNlE/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

<p>How we split these things up into files:</p>

<h3 id="for-each-volume">For each volume:</h3>
<ul class="lil-list">
  <li>One METS XML file with all volume-level metadata (~ 1 MB  avg)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="for-each-page-side">For each page side:</h3>
<ul class="lil-list">
  <li>One lossless jp2 (~2.5 MB avg)</li>
  <li>One 1-bit tiff (~60 KB avg)</li>
  <li>One <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALTO_(XML)">ALTO v3 XML</a> file (~75 KB avg)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="for-each-case">For each case:</h3>
<ul class="lil-list">
  <li>One METS XML file, which includes the text of each case body, and all case-level metadata (~75 KB avg)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-scale">The Scale</h3>
<ul class="lil-list">
  <li>Roughly 37k volumes, so about 37,000 volume XML files</li>
  <li>Roughly 40mil page-sides, so that many jp2s, tiffs, and ALTO XML files</li>
  <li>A bit fewer than 10 million Cases, so that many Case METS XML files</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="our-key-requirements">Our key requirements:</h2>

<h3 id="data-set-versioning">Data Set Versioning</h3>
<p>Ideally this could be done at the corpus or series level (described below.) This would be useful to researchers working with larger sets of data.</p>

<h3 id="sanitizable-change-tracking">Sanitizable Change Tracking</h3>
<p>As is the case with most change-tracking systems, when recording changes, we usually want to be able to ascertain the state of the data before the change, whether this is by recording the old version and the new version, or the delta between the two versions. However, with some change types, we do require the ability to either delete the delta or the old data state. Ideally, we would be able to do this without removing the entire change history for the file.</p>

<h3 id="file-authentication">File Authentication</h3>
<p>People should be able to check if the version of the file they have is, or ever has been in our repository.</p>

<h3 id="open-data-format">Open Data Format</h3>
<p>Even if the change/versioning data isn't natively stored in an easily human-readable format, it must at least be exportable into a useful open format. No strictly proprietary solutions.</p>

<h3 id="access-control">Access Control</h3>
<p>We have to be able to control access to this data.</p>

<h2 id="our-wish-list">Our Wish List</h2>
<ul class="lil-list">
  <li>FOSS (Free Open Source Software) Based Solution</li>
  <li>Diffing — allow downstream databases to fetch deltas between their current version and the latest</li>
  <li>Minimal system management overhead</li>
  <li>Ability to efficiently distribute change history with the data, ideally in a human-readable format</li>
  <li>XML-aware change tracking, so changes can be applied to XML elements with the same identifiers and content, in different files</li>
  <li>Will automatically detect replacement images</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-weve-considered-and-their-disadvantages">What we've considered, and their disadvantages</h2>

<h3 id="git">Git</h3>
<ul class="lil-list">
  <li>Dataset is much too large to store in a single repository</li>
  <li>Non-plain-text change history</li>
  <li>Redacting a single file requires rewriting large portions of the tree</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="media-wiki">Media Wiki</h3>
<ul class="lil-list">
  <li>Not geared to handle XML data</li>
  <li>Would require storing in a different format/syncing</li>
  <li>Non-plain-text change history</li>
  <li>Provides sanitizable change tracking but no versioning of larger data sets</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="bitkeeper">BitKeeper</h3>
<ul class="lil-list">
  <li>Non-plain-text change history</li>
  <li>Seems to not allow easy sanitization of change history</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dat">Dat</h3>
<ul class="lil-list">
  <li>P2P Architecture doesn't give us enough access control for the first phase of the project.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="something-we-write-ourselves">Something we write ourselves</h3>
<ul class="lil-list">
  <li>Reinvents the wheel, at least in part</li>
  <li>Probably not as efficient as more mature tools</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="should-the-data-be-restructured">Should the data be restructured?</h2>

<p>Currently, the repository is fairly flat with each volume in its own directory, but no other hierarchy.</p>

<p>Files could be partitioned by "series." A series is a numbered sequence of volumes from a particular court, such as the Massachusetts Reporter of Decisions. The largest series so far contains approximately 1k volumes, 750k pages, and 215k cases, but they are rather inconsistently sized, with the smallest containing only one volume, and the average containing 71. There are 635 series in total.</p>

<p>Many data consumers will want only case files, and not per-page or per-volume files. It may make sense to store case XML files and non-case-XML files in separate repositories.</p>

<h2 id="what-we-need-from-you">What We Need From You</h2>

<p>Ideas. We want to make sure that we get this right the first time. If you have insight into solving problems like this, we'd love to hear from you.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.rlfbckr.org/work/interface-i">Interface I</a> by Ralf Baecker</strong> — A red horizontal line is adjusted up and down the vertical axis to make a fluid line graph irl. The horizontal line seems to be controlled by hundreds of little motors moving thin clear cable up and down. Gorgeously lit and placed in a large dark room.</p>
