        <p>This is a really good talk.  People give these advice talks about creativity/innovation etc. all the time, but this one by Jack Dorsey (twitter inventor) is absolutely worth the time. really got me thinking. He's a real inventor.  His newest idea is pretty awesome as well.</p>

<p>It also reminded me of the <a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu/twitter/">Library Hose</a>.  Not because of Twitter (which is the broadcast channel for this), but because it was an idea that we did a while back and kinda shelved.  And now its coming back around into ShelfLife.</p>

        <p>So I wonder how we should start recording what people click on and do on the Lib Hose page.  Which books are they clicking to learn more about.</p>

<p>I wonder if the iframe's we're using for the window-in-window effect will obscure anything.</p>

<p>Anyhow, check out this video, you definitely get the gist after a little while, but amazing.  <a href="http://laughingsquid.com/a-2-5-year-old-uses-an-ipad-for-the-first-time/">2.5 year old meets iPad</a></p>

(He's at <a href="http://www.unionsquareventures.com/index.php">Union Square Ventures</a> and has a blog)  This is a summary of the talk he gave at <a href="http://futureofwebapps.com/">Future of Web Apps</a> Conference</p>

<p><strong>Speed</strong> — it just has to work <em>fast</em></p>

<p><strong>Instant Utility</strong> —</p>

<p><strong>Voice</strong> — attitude, style, personality, you should feel like your consuming media (CNN, Fox News) when you're interacting</p>

<p><strong>Less Is More</strong> — Great services are simple.  Example: delicious (which drives our "what we're reading" section).  You can do very little but still be powerful.</p>

<p><strong>Programmable</strong> — APIs, read/write APIs, Absolutely essential to let others contribute functionality to your application.</p>

<p><strong>Personal</strong> — Avatars, Backgrounds, UGC, so people can feel ownership</p>

<p><strong>"RESTful"</strong> — Everything in the application has a url.  And the url has clean and understandable path.   This way the web can access your app in deep ways.  Build on an open architecture.</p>

<p><strong>Discoverable</strong> — Build from the ground up to be discoverable through google, but also through Social Media.  Build from the ground up to be viral.  So it can push itself.</p>

<p><strong>Clean</strong> — The app has to be simple visually, not busy on the page.  Lots of space.  Big fonts.  Not too much functionality per page.  Very inviting.  <a href="http://www.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> is a great example  you just know what to do.</p>

<p><strong>Playful</strong> — Have fun.  The ability to play in an application.  Foster a game dynamic.  Like Weight watchers, you establish goals, you get points and report against goals, you meet goals and are rewarded.</p>

        <p>Saw a presentation yesterday from Dan Reetz who's behind the <a href="http://www.diybookscanner.org/">DIY Book Scanner Project</a>.</p>

<p>He made a real interesting comment which stuck with me.  Computers are going to be the ones reading the most books in the future.  (or something like that, apologies).</p>

<p>If computers will be the biggest readers (because of search), what would books written expressly for computers look like?  I'm not talking metadata, I'm thinking body text.  How should content be expressed to facilitate computer "understanding", or "satisfy" a computer readers.  Would it just be code?</p>

        <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scribblenauts">Scribblenauts</a> is a Nintendo game.  The object is to solve a puzzle.  Say there's a kitten stuck in a tree.  If you type in 'ladder', the puzzle is solved.  If you type in 'jetpack' the puzzle is solved.</p>

<p>So it's definitely different than the rest.  It's innovative.  I'm still not sure exactly what makes it so cool, but I see connections with libraries and potential to somehow apply the cool factor.</p>

<p>I see the game play as a form of searching.  It sort of works the way most people assume or maybe just hope that search works.  Type in your word and the puzzle is solved.  There are many words that will work to solve the same puzzle.</p>

<p>The problem is that search doesn't work like this.  Especially in scholarly research.  There are multiple places to enter keywords.  The keywords that come to mind are often not the ones that will bring relevant results.  All relevant results do not share the same set of keywords.</p>

<p>The game was basically built by researching and recording each noun's metadata.  Librarians and indexers have done a lot of that work already, so why isn't our version working?</p>

          <a href="/blog/2010/03/18/251/ ">Address Bar Grammar</a></h2>
        
          
          <p class="post-author">Posted by <a href="/about/#jeff-goldenson">Jeff Goldenson</a></p>
        
      </header>

      <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">

<p>Address bar grammar kinda sucks. It doesn't even throw us the bone of intuitive legibility.  Let alone to the level of predictability.  It just goes for strict path data.  www.example.com/go_here/then_here/.
It doesn't allow you to shortcut GUI navigation with text entry if you know what you're doing.</p>

<p>One recent Carsonified post was particularly inspiring: <a href="http://carsonified.com/blog/dev/conversational-and-short-urls-on-rails/">Conversational and short URLs on Rails</a></p>

<p>It was written by Jason Lynes, from <a href="http://hulabalub.com/events/in/boston">www.hulabalub.com</a>.  Look at what he does.  He goes for more natural language links in the path by adding clear facet names and the inclusion of prepositions:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">events/in/chicago</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">events/on/design
meetups/on/entrepreneurship/in/san_francisco/with/fred_wilson</code></p>

<p>The introduction of prepositions is awesome.  There is one new thing for folks to learn, "_" is a space for spaced elements acting as one facet,  No big deal.</p>

<hr />

<p>Direct address address bar manipulation could be nice because it "upgrades" gracefully.  If you know what you're doing, you do it and
it's fast.  You do a "natural language" keystroke search in the address bar.  If you don't, you fall back on the website's navigation.</p>

<hr />

<p>I'm curious about taking it a little further.  Usually, headings are followed by attribution info.  So what about if we tried to emulate this by enlisting the help of subdomains, instead of paths?   Let's forget about backend inefficiency for the moment.  What if your homepage is: <code class="highlighter-rouge">home.example.com</code>?  Your "about" page is named <code class="highlighter-rouge">about.example.com</code>?  And on top of that, <code class="highlighter-rouge">aboutpage.example.com</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">about_page.example.com</code> too (so if someone's trying to guess it we'll try and predict mistakes)?  BTW, we'll also have normal GUI navigation as the catch condition.</p>

<p>Can the subdomain act more like a natural language search field?  Could you put <code class="highlighter-rouge">phone.example.com</code>, or <code class="highlighter-rouge">phonenumber.example.com</code>, or
<code class="highlighter-rouge">map.example.com</code> to directly display the map element, or phone number?</p>

        <p>This is definitely a half baked observation of a "pain point".</p>

<p>I was snapping some images from the web, with both the "Snag-It" tool and right-click Save As.</p>

<p>These were JPEGs</p>

<p>But I wanted to cite, within the image, where I got it from on the greater web.  I wanted to keep the provenance.  I wanted to add metadata to this thing, not create some tiny TXT file to write out the data and sit it next to.</p>

<p>I couldn't think of a tool to add personally relevant metadata to non text files, that I could view on my machine.  Notes for me.   (And there are a lot of practical issues about why this is the case, but…)</p>

<p>Why is it my perception that metadata authorship only for the realm of experts?</p>

<p>(excluding websites that support tagging)</p>

<p>…And granted this is probably a nearly Operating System level issue, but it may tie into Ben's observations about packaging metadata.</p>
