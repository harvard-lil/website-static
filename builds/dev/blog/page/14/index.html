        <p>Last week we launched what we think is a useful and appealing way to browse books at scale, timed to coincide with the launch of the <a href="http://dp.la">Digital Public Library of America</a>. (Congrats, DPLA!!!)</p>

<p><a href="http://stacklife-dpla.law.harvard.edu">StackLife DPLA</a> (a  version of what we use to call ShelfLife) shows you a visualization of books on a scrollable shelf, which we turn sideways so you can read the spines. It always shows you books in a context, on the grounds that no book stands alone. You can shift the context instantly, so that you can (for example) see a work on a shelf with all the other books classified under any of the categories professional cataloguers have assigned to it.</p>

<p>We also heatmap the books according to various usage metrics ("StackScore"), so you can get a sense of the work's community relevance.</p>

<p>There are lots more features, and lots more to come.</p>

<p>StackLife DPLA is an intersecting set of functionality with StackLife Harvard we'll be releasing the Harvard version this week. The DPLA version mashes up the books in the Digital Public Library of America's collection (from the <a href="http://http//www.biodiversitylibrary.org/">Biodiversity Heritage Library</a>) with books from The <a href="http://www.archive.org/">Internet Archive</a>‘s <a href="http://demo.openlibrary.org/">Open Library</a> and the <a href="http://www.hathitrust.org">Hathi Trust</a>. These are all online, accessible books, so you can just click and read them. There are 1.7M in the StackLife DPLA metacollection. (Development was funded in part by a Sprint grant from the DPLA. Thank you, DPLA!)</p>

<p>Here are some links:</p>

<p>StackLife DPLA: <a href="http://stacklife-dpla.law.harvard.edu">http://stacklife-dpla.law.harvard.edu</a>
The DPLA press release: <a href="http://library.harvard.edu/stacklife-browse-read-digital">http://library.harvard.edu/stacklife-browse-read-digital</a>
The DPLA version FAQ: <a href="http://stacklife-dpla.law.harvard.edu/#faq/">http://stacklife-dpla.law.harvard.edu/#faq/</a></p>

<p>The StackLife team—along with the fabulous <a href="http://imakewebthings.com/">Caleb Troughton</a>—has worked long and hard on this. We're pretty durn proud. And we're very excited about the launch of the DPLA, too!</p>

<p>The Harvard Library Innovation Lab is looking for a highly creative and motivated developer to dream up and develop innovative projects that chart the future of libraries.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2013/02/group-stylized.jpg" alt="group-stylized" /></p>

        <p>We've created an embeddable widget for the Awesome Box. This widget allows Awesome Box members to share items that have been awesomed without forcing their patrons to visit the Awesome Box site.</p>

<p>Here's an example of the embedded widget:</p>

<p>This partnership is utilizing the new hosted version of our awesome software.  If your library wants to sign up, just drop us a note (<a href="http://awesomebox.io/">http://awesomebox.io/</a>) and we'll get you set up with an account.  All you'll need to start awesoming is a barcode scanner and a box (or basket, or bucket, or barrel).</p>

        <p>[<a href="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/dev/david/podcasts/AndrewOdlyzko-Feb8-2013.mp3">mp3 here</a>]</p>

<p>Last week, <a href="http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/">Andrew Odlyzko</a> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Odlyzko">wikipedia</a>] a mathematician and historian, and former head of the University of Minnesota's Digital Technology Center, posted a <a href="http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/libpubcomp.pdf">research paper</a> that concludes that the data suggest that libraries are losing their competition with the publishers of academic journals. Andrew is a long-time open access advocate, so he's not saying this is a good thing. But he is a data-driven historian.</p>

<p>So I gave him a call, and we talked for about 25 minutes about the paper, and more generally about the role of curators in an age of free or cheap abundance. You can listen <a href="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/dev/david/podcasts/AndrewOdlyzko-Feb8-2013.mp3">here</a>.</p>

<p>Here's Andrew's abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Discussions of the economics of scholarly communication are usually devoted to Open Access, rising journal prices, publisher profits, and boycotts.  That ignores what seems a much more important development in this market.  Publishers, through the oft-reviled  "Big Deal" packages, are providing much greater and more egalitarian access to the journal literature, an approximation to true Open Access.  In the process they're also marginalizing libraries, and obtaining a greater share of the resources going into scholarly communication.  This is enabling a continuation of publisher profits as well as of what for decades has been called "unsustainable journal price escalation."  It is also inhibiting the spread of Open Access, and potentially leading to an oligopoly of publishers controlling distribution through large-scale licensing.</p>

  <p>The "Big Deal" practices are worth studying for several general reasons.  The degree to which publishers succeed in diminishing the role of libraries may be an indicator of the degree and speed at which universities transform themselves.  More importantly, these "Big Deals" appear to point the way to the future of the whole economy, where progress is characterized by declining privacy, increasing price discrimination, increasing opaqueness in pricing, increasing reliance on low-paid or unpaid work of others for profits, and  business models that depend on customer inertia.</p>
</blockquote>

        <p>We recently rolled out more Awesome Boxes here at Harvard. We now have boxes in Widener, Langdell, Lamont, and Cabot.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2012/12/ab-locattion-wild-arrows.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>We have a couple of other boxes waiting to be delivered to their new homes after the new year.</p>

<p><img src="https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2012/12/many-ab-lower-thin.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We put together a special box for our home base, Langdell Library here in the Law School.</p>

<div class="embed-container"><iframe width="320" height="240" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/55814585" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

<p>It's an Arduino equipped box. A small photoresistor in the floor of the box detects light change. When the change is 35% greater or smaller than the last time it took a reading, it sends power to three LEDs tucked in a piece of plexiglass in the sign.</p>

<p>The physical boxes have been fun to build and share, but it's important to keep in mind that they're a minor part of the Awesome Box project. The Awesome Box project is concerned with allowing members of the community to share what they found awesome. You don't need a flashing box to do that. A no-tech solution works just as well and maybe better: Use masking tape to partition an area on the returns desk. When something is placed there, put it on a featured shelf.</p>

<p>We've seen an uptick in awesomeing after we rolled out the additional boxes. We went from about ten items a week to five to ten per day. (These numbers are rough and the sample size is tiny – don't put much stock in them.) So, more boxes yields better community penetration yields results. If you want to have a look at these results, pop over to <a href="http://hrvd.me/awesomebox">http://hrvd.me/awesomebox</a> and follow the <a href="http://twitter.com/hlawesome">Twitter stream</a>.</p>

<p>If you want an Awesome Box for your library, we'd love to hear from you. <a href="mailto:lil@law.harvard.edu">Email us</a>.</p>
